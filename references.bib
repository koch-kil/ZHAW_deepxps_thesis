	abstract = {A non-destructive and rapid moisture content detection method of sand gravel material is required in loose material dams. The near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of sand materials is closely related to its moisture content. Recently, there is a growing need for fully using spectral information when establishing calibration models for sand gravel moisture content detection. To address these issues, a hybrid one dimensional-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) neural network was proposed to detect sand gravel moisture content with NIR spectrum. Two learners, namely, 1D-CNN and Bi-GRU, were constructed to extract local abstract information and sequence position information from the spectrum, respectively. In the 1D-CNN learner, multiple kernels CNN layers and one dimensional-separable convolution layers were conjunct to improve model accuracy and reduce network parameters. In the Bi-GRU learner, a multi-head self-attention mechanism was appended to evaluate the weights of the output features extracted by Bi-GRU layers. The proposed model achieved the best prediction results in LUCAS dataset (R2 greater than 0.75, RPD greater than 2.0) and our sand gravel spectral dataset (R2 = 0.96, RPD = 5.06) compared to other deep learning and conventional spectroscopy analysis methods. In addition, the top ten characteristic wavelength points of sand gravel were identified. These can be used to choose a discrete spectrum measuring instrument, which has a relatively low cost.},

The algorithm gives the set of depth profiles that has maximum Skilling-Jaynes entropy, subject to the condition that the calculated data agree with the measured data within the experimental precision. The method does not require an inverse transform, is robust to experimental noise and is not restricted to small numbers of components. The programme can determine which of a set of prior estimates for the depth profiles is most probable; however, the reconstruction near the surface is virtually independent of this choice. Further, the method also estimates the accuracy of the reconstruction from a single data set. It is illustrated using model data and by a re-analysis of angle-resolved XPS data sets available in the literature.},

	abstract = {The electron attenuation length (AL) is commonly understood to be a measure of the opacity of a solid for a given electron energy in surface-sensitive spectroscopies such as Auger-electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Initially, the term attenuation length was used interchangeably with the term inelastic mean free path (IMFP), the latter being defined as the mean distance between inelastic collisions. However, about 20 years ago, it was realized that elastic-scattering of signal electrons in the solid may considerably influence their trajectories. The projection of a trajectory on a given direction could then have a significantly different length than the length actually traveled, and thus the AL could differ from the IMFP. In addition, calculations showed that the difference between the AL and the IMFP depended on the experimental configuration. It has been generally difficult to measure differences between the AL and the IMFP. Most measurements of the AL, or the recently preferred replacement term effective attenuation length (EAL), have been made from changes of AES or XPS peak intensities as overlayer films of various thicknesses were deposited on a substrate. Unfortunately, the derived EALs generally have large uncertainties because of inadequate knowledge of film morphology and thickness. As a result, EAL values deduced from “universal curves” should be regarded only as rough guides. Furthermore, it has been realized recently that the present formal definition of the EAL is relevant to the determination of the depth of thin marker layers while measurements of AES or XPS intensities have been used to determine EALs (or equivalently, overlayer-film thicknesses have been obtained from AES or XPS intensities and EAL values from the literature). These two approaches would give identical EALs if elastic-scattering effects were negligible but, as we show here, numerical differences arise in situations of practical relevance. We make a further distinction between “local” EALs (based on definitions for a narrow range of overlayer-film thicknesses or marker-layer depths) and “practical” EALs (based on definitions for a specific thickness or depth). We report comparisons of calculated local and practical EALs for XPS with Mg Kα X-rays in a range of measurement configurations for two illustrative cases: Si 2s photoelectrons in Si (for which elastic-electron scattering effects are relatively weak) and Au 4s photoelectrons in Au (for which the elastic-scattering effects are relatively strong). The practical EALs for overlayer-film thickness measurements in conventional XPS experiments are found not to vary appreciably with emission angle for emission angles between 0° and 65°. For this range of emission angles, the practical EALs do not vary significantly with film thickness for a useful range of overlayer-film thicknesses, and it is then useful to make use of average practical EALs for film-thickness measurements. The ratio of the average practical EAL to the corresponding IMFP for these conditions is 0.91 for Si 2s photoelectrons and 0.76 for Au 4s photoelectrons. Practical EALs were also calculated for the N7VV, N5N67V, and M5N67N67 Auger transitions in Au. We found qualitatively similar variations of these practical EALs on film thickness and emission angle as in XPS. It is recommended that overlayer-film thicknesses be determined in AES and XPS using EALs for the particular materials and measurement conditions.},

Among these areas, Chemometrics has been benefited from the application of these algorithms in spectral data analysis. Commonly, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Partial Least Squares are applied to spectral datasets to perform classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we present a 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) to evaluate the effectiveness on spectral data obtained from spectroscopy. In most cases, the spectrum signals are noisy and present overlap among classes. Firstly, we perform extensive experiments including 1D-CNN compared to machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms used in Chemometrics on spectral data classification for the most known datasets available in the literature. Next, spectral samples of the SARS-COV2 virus, which causes the COVID-19, have recently been collected via spectroscopy was used as a case study. Experimental results indicate superior performance of 1D-CNN over machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms, obtaining an average accuracy of 96.5\%, specificity of 98\%, and sensitivity of 94\%.

	abstract = {A convenient measure of surface sensitivity in Auger-electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is the mean escape depth (MED). If the effects of elastic-electron scattering are neglected, the MED is equal to the electron inelastic mean free path (IMFP) multiplied by the cosine of the emission angle with respect to the surface normal, and depends on the material and electron energy of interest. An overview is given here of recent calculations of IMFPs for 50–2000eV electrons in a range of materials. This work has led to the development of a predictive formula based on the Bethe equation for inelastic electron scattering in matter from which IMFPs can be determined. Estimates show, however, that elastic-electron scattering can significantly modify the MED. Thus, for AES, the MED will be reduced by up to about 35\%. For XPS, however, the MED can be changed by up to ±30\% for common measurement conditions although it can be much larger (by up to a factor of 2) for near-grazing emission angles. Ratios of MED values, calculated with elastic scattering considered and neglected for XPS from the 3s, 3p, and 3d subshells of silver with Mg Kα X-rays are approximately constant (to about 10\%) over a range of emission angles that varies from 40° to 60° depending on the subshell and the angle of X-ray incidence. Recommendations are given on how to determine the optimum range of emission angles for satisfactory analysis of angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS) data. Definitions are included of three terms often used for describing surface sensitivity (IMFP, MED, and effective attenuation length (EAL)), and examples are given of the varying magnitudes of these quantities for different analytical conditions.},

The principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is becoming popular not only in the spectroscopic community because it complies with the qualities mentioned above. PCA is, therefore, often used for the processing of detected multivariate signal (characteristic spectra). Over the past decade, PCA has been adopted by the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) community and the number of scientific articles referring to PCA steadily increases. The interest in PCA is not caused only by the basic need to obtain a fast data visualization on a lower dimensional scale and to inspect the most prominent variables. Most recently, PCA has also been applied to yield unconventional data analyses, i.e. processing of large scale LIBS maps. However, a rapid development of LIBS-related instrumentation and applications has led to some non-uniform methodologies in the implementation and utilization of MVDA, including PCA. Thus, in this work, we critically assess and elaborate on the approaches to utilize PCA in LIBS data processing. The aim of this article is also to derive some implications and to suggest advice in data preprocessing, visualization, dimensionality reduction, model building, classification, quantification and non-conventional multivariate mapping. This review reflects also other MVDA algorithms than PCA and consequently, presented conclusions and recommendations can be generalized.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool with applications ranging from quality control to cutting edge biomedical research. One particular area which has seen tremendous advances in the past decade is the development of powerful handheld Raman spectrometers. They have been adopted widely by first responders and law enforcement agencies for the field analysis of unknown substances. Field detection and identification of unknown substances with Raman spectroscopy rely heavily on the spectral matching capability of the devices on hand. Conventional spectral matching algorithms (such as correlation, dot product, etc.) have been used in identifying unknown Raman spectrum by comparing the unknown to a large reference database. This is typically achieved through brute-force summation of pixel-by-pixel differences between the reference and the unknown spectrum. Conventional algorithms have noticeable drawbacks. For example, they tend to work well with identifying pure compounds but less so for mixture compounds. For instance, limited reference spectra inaccessible databases with a large number of classes relative to the number of samples have been a setback for the widespread usage of Raman spectroscopy for field analysis applications. State-of-the-art deep learning methods (specifically convolutional neural networks CNNs), as an alternative approach, presents a number of advantages over conventional spectral comparison algorism. With optimization, they are ideal to be deployed in handheld spectrometers for field detection of unknown substances. In this study, we present a comprehensive survey in the use of one-dimensional CNNs for Raman spectrum identification. Specifically, we highlight the use of this powerful deep learning technique for handheld Raman spectrometers taking into consideration the potential limit in power consumption and computation ability of handheld systems.},

	abstract = {The greater information depth provided in hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) enables nondestructive analyses of the chemistry and electronic structure of buried interfaces. Moreover, for industrially relevant elements like Al, Si, and Ti, the combined access to the Al 1s, Si 1s, or Ti 1s photoelectron line and its associated Al KLL, Si KLL, or Ti KLL Auger transition, as required for local chemical state analysis on the basis of the Auger parameter, is only possible with hard X-rays. Until now, such photoemission studies were only possible at synchrotron facilities. Recently, however, the first commercial XPS/HAXPES systems, equipped with both soft and hard X-ray sources, have entered the market, providing unique opportunities for monitoring the local chemical state of all constituent ions in functional oxides at different probing depths, in a routine laboratory environment. Bulk-sensitive shallow core levels can be excited using either the hard or soft X-ray source, whereas more surface-sensitive deep core-level photoelectron lines and associated Auger transitions can be measured using the hard X-ray source. As demonstrated for thin Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 films, the local chemical state of the constituting ions in the oxide may even be probed at near-constant probing depth by careful selection of sets of photoelectron and Auger lines, as excited with the combined soft and hard X-ray sources. We highlight the potential of lab-based HAXPES for the research on functional oxides and also discuss relevant technical details regarding the calibration of the kinetic binding energy scale.},

	abstract = {Determination of the depth distribution of complex nanostructures by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) inelastic background analysis may be complicated if the sample materials have widely different inelastic scattering cross-sections. It was recently demonstrated that this may be solved by using a mixture of cross-sections. This permits retrieval of depth distributions of complex stacks and deeply buried layers with a typical 5\% accuracy. This requires however that the cross-sections of the individual sample materials are known which is often not the case and this can complicate practical use for routine analysis. In this paper, we explore to what extent a suitable two- or three-parameter cross-section can be defined independent of prior knowledge of the cross-sections involved but simply defined by fitting the cross-section parameters to the spectrum being analyzed. This paper presents a theoretical study following our recent paper that explored how to make the best choice of inelastic mean free path and inelastic scattering cross-section for the inelastic background analysis with the Quases-Tougaard software. It was previously shown that a rough analysis of the inelastic background could give a good idea of the depth distribution. Here, we demonstrate with model spectra from buried layers created with Quases-Tougaard Generate software that a rather accurate analysis can be performed for very different cases with an average 5\% error. This analysis is easy to apply as it only needs the two- or three-parameter cross-sections generated with the Quases-Tougaard software. This study is aimed to improve routine analysis of the inelastic background of XPS and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) spectra.},

It is said that interaction of curcumin with bio molecules such as protein can increase its bioavailability. A simpler alternative to current methods for study of curcumin interaction with biomolecules in biological fluids and the quantification of the interacted curcumin is therefore useful. Herein we demonstrated a method based on ATR-FTIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis for concentration dependent curcumin interaction with serum biomolecules as a model. ATR-FTIR spectra of curcumin-spiked serum samples were acquired and data were processed with two different multivariate methods namely, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLS-R). PCA of the protein region (1701-1304 cm−1) shows a separation into groups based on the concentration of curcumin with no overlaps indicating the curcumin interaction is highest with serum proteins other than lipids and carbohydrates. PLS-R was employed to construct a calibration plot in carbohydrate, protein and lipid regions. The limit of detection of the interaction for all three regions was 10 ppm.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The IMFPs were calculated from experimental optical data using the full Penn algorithm for energies up to 300 eV and the simpler single-pole approximation for higher energies. The calculated IMFPs could be fitted to a modified form of the Bethe equation for inelastic scattering of electrons in matter for energies from 50 eV to 30 keV. The average root-mean-square (RMS) deviation in these fits was 0.48\%. The new IMFPs were also compared with IMFPs from the predictive TPP-2M equation; in these comparisons, the average RMS deviation was 12.3\% for energies between 50 eV and 30 keV. This RMS deviation is almost the same as that found previously in a similar comparison for the 50 eV–2 keV range. Relatively large RMS deviations were found for diamond, graphite and cesium. If these three elements were excluded in the comparison, the average RMS deviation was 9.2\% between 50 eV and 30 keV. We found satisfactory agreement of our calculated IMFPs with IMFPs from recent calculations and from elastic-peak electron-spectroscopy experiments. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Transforming XPS data into meaningful information on the concentration and distribution of chemical species is the topic of this article. In principle, the process is straightforward, but there are a number of pitfalls that must be avoided to ensure that the information is representative and as accurate as possible. This paper sets out the things that should be considered to obtain reliable, meaningful, and useful information from quantitative XPS. This includes the necessity for reference data, instrument performance checks, and a consistent and methodical method for the separation of inelastic background from peaks.

First, dose quantification of Al in ultrathin alumina is achieved through non-destructive wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF), which is confirmed by comparison to destructive liquid-phase deposition inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LPD-ICPMS) (uncertainty 10 \%). Second, we compare WDXRF to parallel ARXPS (pARXPS) in precise dose and thickness quantification in ultrathin alumina, and present the ability of pARXPS to accurately track linear growth during the deposition. Thickness determination of an intermediate ALD stack of silicon dioxide, hafnia, and alumina layers of 1–2 nm by pARXPS is evaluated against quantitative, reference-free grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) (uncertainty 8–9 \%). An alternative technique employing inelastic background analysis (IBA) is introduced as a fast and accurate method and subsequently compared with pARXPS and GIXRF thickness determinations. Finally, in thicker multilayer systems, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) combined with IBA is proposed for an in-depth analysis for thicknesses up to 28 nm, with generated interface locations and layer thicknesses well-aligned to nominal values. This study is a novel application of lab-based Cr-Kα HAXPES spectra for inelastic background analysis in thick metal-oxide multilayer materials.},

	abstract = {As an effective technology, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be widely applied to analysis of active ingredients in medicinal fungi. Multiple regression methods are used to compute the relationship between spectral vectors and ingredient contents. In this paper, an autonomous feature extraction method by using attention based residual network (ABRN) to model original NIRS vectors is introduced. Attention module in ABRN is employed to enhance feature wave bands and to decay noise. Different from traditional NIRS analysis methods, ABRN does not require any preprocessing of artificial feature selections which rely on expert experience. The experiments test ABRN by analyzing original spectrums of medicinal fungi (Antrodia Camphorata and Matsutake), which are from 800 nm to 2500 nm, and predicting active ingredients within them. We compare ABRN with other popular NIRS analysis methods. The root mean square error of Antrodia Camphorata training set (RMSET) and validation set (RMSEV) are 0.0229 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and 0.0349 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for polysaccharide, and 0.0173 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and 0.0189 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for triterpene. The RMSET and RMSEV of Matsutake are 0.1343 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and 0.2472 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for polysaccharide, and 0.0328 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and 0.0445 \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}·{\textbackslash}mathcal\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for ergosterol. The (coefficient of determination) of these four ingredients are 0.711, 0.753, 0.847 and 0.807.

	abstract = {We present a perspective on the use of XPS relative peak intensities for determining composition in homogeneous bulk materials. Nonhomogenous effects, such as composition variation with depth or severe topography effects (e.g., in nanoparticles), are not discussed. We consider only the use of conventional laboratory-based instruments with x-ray sources, Alkα or Mgkα. We address accuracy (not precision, which is much more straightforward) using relative sensitivity factors, RSFs, obtained either empirically from standards (e-RSF) or from the use of theoretical cross sections, σ, (t-RSF). Issues involved are (1) the uncertainty of background subtraction of inelastically scattered electrons, (2) the accuracy of the RSFs, and (3) the role of XPS peak satellite structure, which affects both (1) and (2) above. The XPS of materials tends to fall into two broad classes: where the signals being used for quantification are “main” peaks, which are narrower and more symmetric, followed by a relatively low background with only weak satellite structure and where the “main” peaks are broader and often asymmetric, followed by backgrounds that are higher and have a stronger satellite structure. The former generally will yield better accuracy, more easily, than the latter. The latter comprises all compounds containing elements with open valence shell electrons. These are mostly the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals, the lanthanides, and the actinides. Compounds involving only the first row elements, Li to F, where the 1s binding energy is used for quantitation, are those where the best accuracy is potentially achievable. We specifically address the issue of long-claimed serious discrepancies between e-RSFs and t-RSFs, which were interpreted as indicating calculated σs, used as a parameter in t-RSFs, were seriously in error. We conclude this claim to be untrue and that, if done correctly, there is no disagreement between the two approaches within the limits of accuracy claimed. Finally, we suggest protocols for rapid element composition analysis by obtaining relative XPS signal intensities using only low energy resolution.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of XPS and AES quantification by peak shape analysis was established from a detailed analysis of a range of model spectra and three sets of experiments. It was found that information on the concentration–depth profile in the surface region up to depths of ∽5λi (where λi is the inelastic electron mean free path) is primarily contained in the spectral energy region up to ∽100 eV below the peak energy and is essentially completely contained by the energy region up to ∽200 eV below the peak. Analysis of a larger energy range than 100 eV does not add much to the information on the details of the structure in the outermost 5λi but gives the possibility to determine additional structural parameters that describe the composition at larger depths. The structural parameters that describe the chemical composition of the outermost 5–10λi of the solid were divided into primary and secondary parameters: the primary parameters are the three most important parameters needed to describe the main characteristics of the distribution of atoms; the secondary parameters are parameters other than the three primary parameters that describe the finer details of the depth distribution of atoms in the outermost 5–10λi of the surface region. The uncertainty in the determined three primary parameters is typically 5–10\%. The uncertainty in the determined secondary parameters is typically ≳35\%. Different models of depth profiles can be distinguished when they differ significantly over a width of more than ∽1/3λi at any depth ≲5λi. The uncertainty in the total determined amounts of atoms within the surface region is ∽5–10\% as long as the depths are within the primary probing depth of the method (i.e. {\textless}5λi). The absolute quantification of a set of samples where the in-depth distribution varies considerably gives a root-mean-square scatter of 15\%. This is reduced to ∽10\% when elastic scattering effects are modelled by a simple analytical expression. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This guide is intended for both the novice in x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as users with some experience. XPS is one of the most widely used methods to characterize surface nanostructured samples, and XPS is now also commonly accessible to most material scientists through XPS facility centers. It is, therefore, increasingly used as a routine analysis technique to complement other techniques. This has led to an increase in the number of users who may not have a full understanding of the details of XPS and consequently must rely on the report provided by the XPS center. The purpose of this practical guide on the aspects of quantitative XPS is first to put the reader in a position to be able to understand and judge the meaning and possible errors in atomic concentrations based on analysis of peak intensities, which is the standard way quantitative XPS is reported. We discuss different ways to improve the analysis. This is attained by giving the reader a good understanding of how the intensities in the peak and the background of inelastically scattered electrons are linked together through the depth distribution of atoms. We then explore how this can be applied to greatly increase the capabilities of XPS to more accurately determine the composition and structure of surfaces on the nanoscale. This is possible at different levels of sophistication. We first see how a visual inspection of the XPS survey spectrum can be applied to get a quick rough indication of the structure. Next, we go through other more quantitative methods that are being used. The practical application of these techniques is illustrated by several examples.},

The IMFPs were calculated from experimental optical data using the full Penn algorithm for energies up to 300 eV and the simpler single-pole approximation for higher energies. The calculated IMFPs could be fitted to a modified form of the Bethe equation for inelastic scattering of electrons in matter for energies from 50 eV to 30 keV. The average root-mean-square (RMS) deviation in these fits was 0.48\%. The new IMFPs were also compared with IMFPs from the predictive TPP-2M equation; in these comparisons, the average RMS deviation was 12.3\% for energies between 50 eV and 30 keV. This RMS deviation is almost the same as that found previously in a similar comparison for the 50 eV–2 keV range. Relatively large RMS deviations were found for diamond, graphite and cesium. If these three elements were excluded in the comparison, the average RMS deviation was 9.2\% between 50 eV and 30 keV. We found satisfactory agreement of our calculated IMFPs with IMFPs from recent calculations and from elastic-peak electron-spectroscopy experiments. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The paper critically discusses for a wide spread of examples the possibilities of such a methodology especially in connection with data analysis procedures like factor analysis, but also the limitations occurring due to bombardment-induced damage. It is concluded that despite of that damage useful binding state information can be derived in many cases, however, the amount of distortion has to be checked critically in every case.},

To this end, we have studied a patterned structure made by thermally oxidising a silicon wafer. We have studied the O 1s, Si 2p and C 1s peaks which have rather low photoionization cross sections. In addition we have not used high spectrometer pass energy. Therefore, the signal-to-noise level for these spectra was very low. We have investigated the extent to which different noise reduction procedures can improve the quantitative images obtained. The original data has been processed using four different methods: (1) smoothing using a quadratic, 7-point Savitzky–Golay filtering followed by averaging the spectrum for each pixel with spectra from nearest neighbours (2) principal component analysis (PCA) (3) PCA followed by smoothing and (4) PCA followed first by smoothing and then by averaging. We have shown that for noisy spectra, PCA significantly improves the images of both the amount of substance (AOS) in the outermost few nanometers and also the XPS-images of the different in-depth distributions of oxygen, carbon and silicon atoms. The images of the depth profiles for the different elements in the sample studied are found to be consistent. This result is important because in imaging, data acquisition time is a limiting factor, which can be reduced by effective noise reduction procedures.},

	abstract = {In order to determine the most appropriate method of measuring film thickness using imaging XPS, a series of thin polymer films have been prepared and analysed using spectroscopy. The thickness of these thin polymer films has been determined using peak shape analysis and by using photoelectron peak areas compared with a bulk reference and by using relative sensitivity factors. These results have been compared with values obtained using ellipsometry. The values obtained by measuring photoelectron peak areas were seen to be influenced by the chemistry of the film, so that a bulk reference of similar chemistry to the film is required for accurate thickness measurement. The values obtained using peak shape analysis, both interactive and non-interactive, were not dependent on the chemistry of the film and showed good agreement with ellipsometry. Imaging of a patterned polymer film was successfully carried out, and the polymer cross section was shown to provide a reasonable description of the inelastic background from the carbonaceous contamination layer. An image of the substrate photoelectron intensity was successfully corrected for attenuation in both the carbonaceous contamination layer and the polymer film simultaneously using an image of the film thickness determined by non-interactive peak shape analysis. This procedure is suitable for automated film thickness measurement and correction for attenuation in the carbonaceous contamination layer in both spectroscopy and imaging.

With an understanding of the limits and possible issues with using AdC for charge referencing purposes and by incorporating other methodologies (Auger parameter, checks for data self-consistency, well-established peak-fitting routines) it was found that using AdC C 1s for charge referencing gave satisfactory and meaningful results in 95\% of the 522 cases assessed. Differential charging is a common issue including in studies assessing AdC binding energies.

	abstract = {This guide is intended for both the novice in x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as users with some experience. XPS is one of the most widely used methods to characterize surface nanostructured samples, and XPS is now also commonly accessible to most material scientists through XPS facility centers. It is, therefore, increasingly used as a routine analysis technique to complement other techniques. This has led to an increase in the number of users who may not have a full understanding of the details of XPS and consequently must rely on the report provided by the XPS center. The purpose of this practical guide on the aspects of quantitative XPS is first to put the reader in a position to be able to understand and judge the meaning and possible errors in atomic concentrations based on analysis of peak intensities, which is the standard way quantitative XPS is reported. We discuss different ways to improve the analysis. This is attained by giving the reader a good understanding of how the intensities in the peak and the background of inelastically scattered electrons are linked together through the depth distribution of atoms. We then explore how this can be applied to greatly increase the capabilities of XPS to more accurately determine the composition and structure of surfaces on the nanoscale. This is possible at different levels of sophistication. We first see how a visual inspection of the XPS survey spectrum can be applied to get a quick rough indication of the structure. Next, we go through other more quantitative methods that are being used. The practical application of these techniques is illustrated by several examples.},

An average adventitious carbon (AdC) C 1s binding energy of 284.91 eV (Std. Dev. 0.25 eV) was found for 117 samples that also contained a secondary charge reference possibility. With an understanding of the limits and possible issues with using AdC for charge referencing purposes and by incorporating other methodologies (Auger parameter, checks for data self-consistency, well-established peak-fitting routines) it was found that using AdC C 1s for charge referencing gave satisfactory and meaningful results in 95\% of the 522 cases assessed. Differential charging is a common issue including in studies assessing AdC binding energies. This work demonstrates that electrical isolation (floating) of mixed insulating/semi-conducting/conducting samples significantly improves outcomes by mitigating differential charging issues.},

	abstract = {As an effective technology, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be widely applied to analysis of active ingredients in medicinal fungi. Multiple regression methods are used to compute the relationship between spectral vectors and ingredient contents. In this paper, an autonomous feature extraction method by using attention based residual network (ABRN) to model original NIRS vectors is introduced. Attention module in ABRN is employed to enhance feature wave bands and to decay noise. Different from traditional NIRS analysis methods, ABRN does not require any preprocessing of artificial feature selections which rely on expert experience. The experiments test ABRN by analyzing original spectrums of medicinal fungi (Antrodia Camphorata and Matsutake), which are from 800 nm to 2500 nm, and predicting active ingredients within them. We compare ABRN with other popular NIRS analysis methods. The root mean square error of Antrodia Camphorata training set (RMSET) and validation set (RMSEV) are 0.0229 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ and 0.0349 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ for polysaccharide, and 0.0173 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ and 0.0189 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ for triterpene. The RMSET and RMSEV of Matsutake are 0.1343 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ and 0.2472 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ for polysaccharide, and 0.0328 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ and 0.0445 \textit{g}·\textit{g}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ for ergosterol. The \textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}$ (coefficient of determination) of these four ingredients are 0.711, 0.753, 0.847 and 0.807. The results indicate that ABRN has better performance in autonomously extracting feature wave bands from original NIRS vectors, which can decrease the loss of tiny feature peaks.},

	abstract = {An analysis is made of some of the problems associated with the measurement of signal-to-noise ratios in electron spectroscopy. We develop here the assessment of the signal-to-noise ratio for counting systems, in particular where the statistics are Poissonian. In order to measure the noise statistics accurately it is shown that at least 135 measures of the counts at a given setting are required. These may help to confirm or disprove the Poissonian nature of the count. At high counting rates the counting system dead time causes deviations from the Poissonian character. However, if the counting system gives Poissonian statistics, simple equations may be used to give the signal-to-noise values from spectral measurements. In systems with more than one detector the allocation of the data from the different detectors to different spectral energy channels may provide some effective smoothing so that the noise appearing in the spectrum may be up to 25\% too low compared with a Poissonian estimate. In this case the true signal-to-noise ratio may only be observed from the detector outputs directly, prior to data reduction by the computer. In practical situations the dominance of the Poissonian counting statistics should be exhibited over most of the effective measurement range. However, when searching at the limits of spatial resolution in AES (very low beam currents) or at the highest sensitivity (small signals on a large background) in AES or XPS, other noise sources become important and should be considered.},

	abstract = {In order to determine the most appropriate method of measuring film thickness using imaging XPS, a series of thin polymer films have been prepared and analysed using spectroscopy. The thickness of these thin polymer films has been determined using peak shape analysis and by using photoelectron peak areas compared with a bulk reference and by using relative sensitivity factors. These results have been compared with values obtained using ellipsometry. The values obtained by measuring photoelectron peak areas were seen to be influenced by the chemistry of the film, so that a bulk reference of similar chemistry to the film is required for accurate thickness measurement. The values obtained using peak shape analysis, both interactive and non-interactive, were not dependent on the chemistry of the film and showed good agreement with ellipsometry. Imaging of a patterned polymer film was successfully carried out, and the polymer cross section was shown to provide a reasonable description of the inelastic background from the carbonaceous contamination layer. An image of the substrate photoelectron intensity was successfully corrected for attenuation in both the carbonaceous contamination layer and the polymer film simultaneously using an image of the film thickness determined by non-interactive peak shape analysis. This procedure is suitable for automated film thickness measurement and correction for attenuation in the carbonaceous contamination layer in both spectroscopy and imaging.

	abstract = {Abstract   This work addresses the ubiquitous presence of organic contaminants at inorganic solid surfaces and the improvement of XPS analysis selectivity to cope with it. Water contact angle measurements showed that the adsorption of organic contaminants occurs readily in ambient air, and faster and more extensively under high vacuum. It is stronger on stainless steel (SS) compared to silica and is significantly reduced when SS is sterilized by autoclaving. The reliability of XPS data was evaluated (selectivity, precision, accuracy) by correlations between spectral data incorporating a large amount of results obtained with different XPS spectrometers on SS and glass samples cleaned in different ways and conditioned with several biomacromolecules. The methodology used allows a discrimination to be made between contaminants and deliberately adsorbed biomacromolecules, and offers perspectives for tracking the source of contamination. Furthermore, a discrimination can be made between oxygen from the organic adlayer and oxygen from the substrate, and the O 1s component above 532.0eV observed for SS is shown to be due to organic contaminants rather than adsorbed water. This approach offers new perspectives to examine the interactions (displacement or not) between contaminants and compounds of interest, e.g. proteins, at the stage of the adsorption process.},

The most commonly available software are SESSA and QUASES-Tougaard. In this paper, we present and compare these software for the analysis of the inelastic background of X-ray photoelectron spectra. The QUASES-Tougaard software is a dedicated software for inelastic background analysis already well known for allowing to retrieve the depth distribution of complex stacks and deeply buried layers with a typical 5\% accuracy. SESSA is a well-known software to facilitate quantitative interpretation of XPS spectra and to improve the accuracy of quantitative analysis but it is less commonly used for inelastic background analysis. This paper compares their capability to retrieve the depth distribution of elements and presents their main differences and complementarities. The two approaches are discussed using three well different systems from the microelectronic field with different levels of complexity such as the recurrence of an element in several layers or the combination of elements presenting very different cross-sections.},

	abstract = {Surface chemical analysis by XPS is more than 60 years old. During the last 15 years ther-e has been an explosive growth in the publication of XPS peak-fits and interpretations. Unfortunately, these publications suffer from a variety of problems in reliability and usefulness because the new authors are not familiar enough with the science and application of XPS, chemical state assignments, and peak-fitting. Efforts to help new users include journal publications such as self-training guides for peak-fitting, international standards, collections of BEs, examples of peak-fitting, and more. These user guides are useful and are published in journals that are known to publish XPS information. The basics of XPS are taught at a few graduate level courses in universities and there are 3–5 day training courses at conferences, but the need is much greater. To help the international XPS community and the infrequent users of XPS to overcome these limitations, problems and needs, The XPS Library™ was formed as a non-profit institute to provide an on-line resource of XPS information, self-training material, free {\textgreater}70,000 monochromatic XPS reference spectra, free spectral data processing software, reference tables, links, examples of good and bad peak-fitting, and more. In 1986, this author began to build The XPS Spectra-Base™ by collecting and organizing detailed sets of “self-consistent” monochromatic XPS spectra from reference materials, natural crystals, man-made single crystals, and commercial products. The current number of individual spectra in digital form is {\textgreater}70,000 and the number of materials is {\textgreater}9,000. Each set of spectra (4–10) is stored inside individual data directories having the name of the material analyzed. Multiple data directories belonging to the same category are placed in a directory with the name of that category. Each category name is distinct and is based on the chemistry of the materials. Currently, “XPS Library” members must download individual sets of spectra or full directories that are stored in ZIP files. To view, peak-fit, export, analyze, overlay, process, or print the spectra provided by The XPS Spectra-Base the library member needs a software that can import or directly open spectra having: VAMAS-ISO 14,976 ASCII file format, other ASCII file formats (XY, XYZ), or the SDP binary file format. Most software from the instrument makers can import these types of spectra. The “Spectral Data Processor” (SDP™) v8.0 is a 32-bit Windows™ (v7−10 compatible) software is provided free of charge to library members. Using SDP v8 the user can: (a) access and open the raw or processed spectra downloaded from The XPS Spectra-Base, (b) save all processing results and labels to permanent memory, (c) completely reprocess, peak-fit, analyze, overlay, process, or print the spectra, (d) export or save the raw or processed spectra in VAMAS-ISO ASCII and other ASCII file formats, and (e) import spectra having VAMAS-ISO 14,976 ASCII file format and other ASCII file formats (XY, XYZ). Several thousand High Energy Resolution Auger Electron Spectra (HER-AES) from insulators, conductors, and native oxides will be added. All spectra are owned, copyrighted, and are the property of The XPS Library and are protected by a registered international copyright (TX 4−560-881).},

This analysis covers single element samples measured for Al and Mg Kα X-rays. The spectral data are for widescans at 1 eV energy intervals with kinetic energies from 200 to 1506 eV using Al X-rays and to 1273 eV using Mg X-rays. In addition are narrow scans around the photoelectron peaks at 0.1 eV energy intervals. All spectra have the instrument intensity/energy response function removed so that the peak areas are proportional to the number of electrons emitted per steradian per incident Kα photon. Correlations are made for the ionisation cross sections of Scofield and the inelastic mean free paths given by the TPP-2M formula. The correlations are excellent, apart from a factor which may be associated with the background removal arising from the use of the Tougaard Universal cross section. These correlations lead directly to pure element relative sensitivity factors suitable for quantitative analysis. General equations are also provided to extract values for a new form of relative sensitivity factor for an average matrix. These average matrix relative sensitivity factors lead to simpler equations involving matrix factors that are effectively unity instead of the traditional values in the range 0.3 to 3.0.},

The system for Auger electron and X-ray photoelectron spectrometers combined has been used regularly to calibrate the  Metrology Spectrometer II  at NPL and experience shows that this gives an instrumental intensity consistency of 0.4\% over 10 years. Evaluations have not previously been reported at this level. The system for Auger electron and X-ray photoelectron spectrometers combined is used here in preference to the system solely for X-ray photoelectron spectrometers since it is more robust to the sample condition and can be used over a wider energy range.

This computer is also used for processing the captured data, using routines from a built-in set of options for peak synthesis, peak deconvolution, background subtraction, peak area measurement, quantification in various levels of sophistication, mapping, depth profile presentation, smoothing, differentiation and a host of other functions. However, many analysts wish to process their data on another computer in their own particular way using programs written to their specification and under their full control. They need to encode the data in the data-capture computer into a form suitable for transmission then decode it into the form required in the receiving computer. A standard format for the transferred data would clearly lead to economies in the number of programs required to effect the encoding and decoding. To meet the above requirement, as a result of a series of iterative discussions over the last three years, first within the UKESCA Users Group and then with the VAMAS National Representatives and users and manufacturers within the VAMAS Community as well as the ASTM Committee E-42.11, we have produced a Surface Chemical Analysis Standard Data Transfer Format defined in a standard metalanguage. This Format is intended to be used by those wishing to transfer data from computer to computer via parallel interfaces or via serial interfaces over direct wire, telephone line, local area network or other communications link. It is suitable for AES, EDX, FABMS, ISS, SIMS, SNMS, UPS, XPS, XRF and similar analytical methods. It covers elemental maps, depth profiles and sequences of data resulting from a variety of experiments. Thus the application of the Format is very general.},

Specifically, the training acts on the spectral domain and seeks to modify the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of transfer operators in direct space. The proposed method is ductile and can be tailored to return either linear or non-linear classifiers. Adjusting the eigenvalues, when freezing the eigenvectors entries, yields performances that are superior to those attained with standard methods restricted to operate with an identical number of free parameters. To recover a feed-forward architecture in direct space, we have postulated a nested indentation of the eigenvectors. Different non-orthogonal basis could be employed to export the spectral learning to other frameworks, as e.g. reservoir computing.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is increasingly used to make pre-dictions on biomedical and social science data. A ubiquitous challenge in such applications is that the training data is often incomplete: certain attributes of samples could be missing. Moreover, there could be complex structures in the pattern of which attributes are missing - for example, whether the glucose level is measured for a participant may depend on his/her other attributes (e.g., age) as well as on the prediction target (say, diabetes status). We propose a general embedding approach to learn representations for missingness. The embedding can be a modular layer of any neural network architecture and it's learned at the same time as the networks learn to make predictions. This approach bypasses the need to first impute the missing attributes, which is a key limitation because standard imputation methods require random missingness. Our systematic experimental evaluations demonstrate that missingness embedding significantly improves the prediction accuracy especially when the data missingness has structures, which is typical in practice. We show that the embedding is robust to changes in the missingness of test data (domain-adaptation) and discuss how the embedding reveals insights on the underlying missing mechanism.},

	abstract = {Visible and Near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Vis–NIR) serves as a rapid and non-destructive technique to estimate various soil properties. Recently, there is a growing need for developing a more accurate and robust calibration model in large soil spectral libraries to support the implementation of effective soil quality assessments and digital soil maps at national, continental and even global scales. Traditional calibration methods, such as partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machines regression(SVMR), multivariate adaptive regression splines(MARS), random forests(RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN), may not be successfully applied in large spectral libraries due to their relatively weak generation performance in large regions. To overcome these weaknesses, we proposed a jointed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture called CCNVR, which combines the ability of CNN to extract the local and abstract features from the raw spectrum with the advantage of RNN to learn various dependencies of sequence features. We then compared the prediction accuracy of CCNVR with other conventional methods, namely, PLSR, SVMR, CNN, ANN, and RNN, on the selected soil properties of mineral soil samples in the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) database. Of all calibration models, our proposed CCNVR achieved the best model performance with the lowest RMSE value (6.40, 0.45, 3.30, and 0.35 for OC, N, CEC, and pH, respectively) and the highest R2 (0.73, 0.70, 0.73, and 0.86 for OC, N, CEC, and pH, respectively) for the selected properties, indicating the outstanding prediction ability of our proposed model. Besides, to quantify the robustness of different calibration models, we added different levels of white noise on the original Vis–NIR spectra of the calibration set to observe how the prediction accuracy changes in the test set. The result showed that our proposed CCNVR model has a better resistance towards noise compared to other calibration models. Finally, we explored the transferability of our proposed CCNVR model. We extended the calibration model trained on the mineral samples to the organic samples through transfer learning. The result revealed that the transfer-based CCNVR fine-tuning model had a better prediction accuracy than that of the non-transfer CCNVR model with an improvement of R2 value from 0.79 to 0.84. The result demonstrated the excellent transferability of our proposed CCNVR model across different soil types and sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is nondestructive, fast, and straightforward. Recently, a growing number of pasta companies have been using IR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics to quickly determine sample parameters. However, fewer models have used deep learning models to classify cooked wheat food products and even fewer have used deep learning models to classify Italian pasta. To solve these problems, an improved CNN–LSTM neural network is proposed to identify pasta in different physical states (frozen vs. thawed) using IR spectroscopy. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were constructed to extract the local abstraction and sequence position information from the spectra, respectively. The results showed that the accuracy of the CNN–LSTM model reached 100\% after using principal component analysis (PCA) on the Italian pasta spectral data in the thawed state and 99.44\% after using PCA on the Italian pasta spectral data in the frozen form, verifying that the method has high analytical accuracy and generalization. Therefore, the CNN–LSTM neural network combined with IR spectroscopy helps to identify different pasta products.},

	abstract = {Recently, Raman Spectroscopy (RS) was demonstrated to be a non-destructive way of cancer diagnosis, due to the uniqueness of RS measurements in revealing molecular biochemical changes between cancerous vs. normal tissues and cells. In order to design computational approaches for cancer detection, the quality and quantity of tissue samples for RS are important for accurate prediction. In reality, however, obtaining skin cancer samples is difficult and expensive due to privacy and other constraints. With a small number of samples, the training of the classifier is difficult, and often results in overfitting. Therefore, it is important to have more samples to better train classifiers for accurate cancer tissue classification. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel generative adversarial network based skin cancer tissue classification framework. Specifically, we design a data augmentation module that employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic RS data resembling the training data classes. The original tissue samples and the generated data are concatenated to train classification modules. Experiments on real-world RS data demonstrate that (1) data augmentation can help improve skin cancer tissue classification accuracy, and (2) generative adversarial network can be used to generate reliable synthetic Raman spectroscopic data.},

	abstract = {As a group of subject-matter experts in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and other material characterization techniques from different countries and institutions, we write this document to raise awareness of an epidemic of poor and incorrect materials data analysis in the literature. This issue is a growing problem with many causes and very undesirable consequences. It contributes to what has been called a “reproducibility crisis”, which is a recent concern of the U.S. National Academies of Science (Baker, 2016; Harris, 2017; NASE\&amp;M, 2019).Over the past decade material analysis techniques have matured to the point that dedicated expert operators are often not considered to be necessary to collect and analyze data, especially when the samples are perceived as simple or routine. The tools in this growing arsenal, including XPS, are now used in academia, industry, and government laboratories to provide both compositional information and a mechanistic understanding of a wide variety of materials. This situation, coupled with increased accessibility of the equipment, improved instrument reliability, and the promise of useful data, has resulted in significant growth in the number of researchers using these characterization tools and reporting material analysis data. Although many of the resulting papers are of high quality, especially in journals that focus on materials characterization, others are unsatisfactory. In an ongoing analysis of XPS data in journals that emphasize next generation materials, we find that about 30\% of the analyses are completely incorrect (Linford and Major, 2019). Thus, for some applications, inappropriate data analysis has reached a critical stage, making it difficult for researchers lacking the relevant expertise to find and readily identify reliable examples of what would be considered good-quality data analysis. The errors we are observing in the literature are not limited to journals that may be deemed to be of lower impact—they regularly appear in what are identified as upper-tier/high-impact-factor journals. It is not uncommon to similarly find that 20–30\% of the analyses of data from other material characterization techniques are also incorrect (Chirico et al., 2013; Park et al., 2017). The consequences of this issue are significantly greater than merely having a few poorly executed figures in otherwise good papers. Results and conclusions in a study hinge on the data collected and analyzed. If the characterization of a material is incorrect, an entire work may be fundamentally flawed. In some areas, the proliferation of advanced analytical instruments appears to have exceeded the world's supply of expertise necessary to collect, interpret, and review the results obtained from them.},

	abstract = {The terms inelastic mean free path (IMFP), effective attenuation length (EAL), and mean escape depth (MED) are frequently used to specify the surface sensitivity of Auger-electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These terms are different conceptually because of the effects of elastic-electron scattering, and generally have different numerical values for a specified material and electron energy. In addition, values of the EAL and MED depend on the instrumental configuration. We give an historical overview of efforts to measure EALs by the overlayer method and of work to investigate elastic-scattering effects in AES and XPS. We then apply an analytical formalism developed from a solution of the kinetic Boltzmann equation within the transport approximation to demonstrate the relationships between the IMFP, EAL, and MED for selected elemental solids and for common measurement conditions. Examples are given to show the magnitude of elastic-scattering effects on MED values for angle-resolved XPS and AES. If XPS or AES data are acquired for emission angles between zero and 60°, the ratio of the MED to that found with elastic scattering neglected is approximately constant (to within 10\%), and this ratio can be used to determine an average value for the EAL. This EAL value can then be used to establish the depth scale in the data analysis. Finally, we show ratios of the EAL to the IMFP for XPS from the Au 4s subshell with Mg Kα X-rays as a function of emission angle and depth; this ratio has a weak dependence on emission angle from zero to 40° but a more pronounced dependence for larger emission angles.},

	abstract = {Visible and Near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Vis–NIR) serves as a rapid and non-destructive technique to estimate various soil properties. Recently, there is a growing need for developing a more accurate and robust calibration model in large soil spectral libraries to support the implementation of effective soil quality assessments and digital soil maps at national, continental and even global scales. Traditional calibration methods, such as partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machines regression(SVMR), multivariate adaptive regression splines(MARS), random forests(RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN), may not be successfully applied in large spectral libraries due to their relatively weak generation performance in large regions. To overcome these weaknesses, we proposed a jointed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture called CCNVR, which combines the ability of CNN to extract the local and abstract features from the raw spectrum with the advantage of RNN to learn various dependencies of sequence features. We then compared the prediction accuracy of CCNVR with other conventional methods, namely, PLSR, SVMR, CNN, ANN, and RNN, on the selected soil properties of mineral soil samples in the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) database. Of all calibration models, our proposed CCNVR achieved the best model performance with the lowest RMSE value (6.40, 0.45, 3.30, and 0.35 for OC, N, CEC, and pH, respectively) and the highest R2 (0.73, 0.70, 0.73, and 0.86 for OC, N, CEC, and pH, respectively) for the selected properties, indicating the outstanding prediction ability of our proposed model. Besides, to quantify the robustness of different calibration models, we added different levels of white noise on the original Vis–NIR spectra of the calibration set to observe how the prediction accuracy changes in the test set. The result showed that our proposed CCNVR model has a better resistance towards noise compared to other calibration models. Finally, we explored the transferability of our proposed CCNVR model. We extended the calibration model trained on the mineral samples to the organic samples through transfer learning. The result revealed that the transfer-based CCNVR fine-tuning model had a better prediction accuracy than that of the non-transfer CCNVR model with an improvement of R2 value from 0.79 to 0.84. The result demonstrated the excellent transferability of our proposed CCNVR model across different soil types and sample sizes.},

	abstract = {We assess advanced XPS-based methods in determining depth distribution in alumina and hafnia ALD samples of increasing thicknesses and buried layer depths. First, dose quantification of Al in ultrathin alumina is achieved through non-destructive wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF), which is confirmed by comparison to destructive liquid-phase deposition inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LPD-ICPMS) (uncertainty 10 \%). Second, we compare WDXRF to parallel ARXPS (pARXPS) in precise dose and thickness quantification in ultrathin alumina, and present the ability of pARXPS to accurately track linear growth during the deposition. Thickness determination of an intermediate ALD stack of silicon dioxide, hafnia, and alumina layers of 1–2 nm by pARXPS is evaluated against quantitative, reference-free grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) (uncertainty 8–9 \%). An alternative technique employing inelastic background analysis (IBA) is introduced as a fast and accurate method and subsequently compared with pARXPS and GIXRF thickness determinations. Finally, in thicker multilayer systems, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) combined with IBA is proposed for an in-depth analysis for thicknesses up to 28 nm, with generated interface locations and layer thicknesses well-aligned to nominal values. This study is a novel application of lab-based Cr-Kα HAXPES spectra for inelastic background analysis in thick metal-oxide multilayer materials.},

	abstract = {Aim of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of two different types of n-octenylsuccinate-derivatised starch, which significantly differed in viscosity, for microencapsulation of a fish oil rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Stable feed emulsions for microencapsulation could be prepared with both types of n--octenylsuccinate starch, however at a high oil load (50\%), a low pH (pH 4.5) of the emulsion was crucial for emulsion stability. At 50\% oil content, lower oil droplet size in reconstituted spray-dried emulsions and lower content of non-encapsulated oil was reached by low viscosity starch compared to medium viscosity starch. Conjugated dienes were significantly increased in samples with a high oil load and 40\% starch indicating that to a certain degree lipid oxidation already occurred in these samples during the drying process. Finally, moderate spray-drying conditions must be considered as advantageous, since ballooning of the particles and lipid oxidation during spray drying were limited compared to drying at high spray-drying temperatures.},

	abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has become one of the most widely used surface analysis techniques, and XPS instrumentation has become more user friendly, making the technique available to a large number of researchers. The number of experts in the field, however, has not increased, and XPS data are often misinterpreted in the literature. This paper is intended to provide an introduction to XPS for prospective or novice users. We present the basic principles of the technique including (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) how electrons interact with matter and escape from a surface and how this determines the surface sensitivity of the technique, and (3) how the chemical environment around an element affects the binding energy of its electrons. A description of the instrumentation helps a novice user understand how data are acquired, and information is included on sample preparation and mounting. The important parameters for data acquisition are noted to help guide users starting to acquire data. Interpretation of data on both a qualitative and quantitative level is discussed, and additional sections provide information on more advanced techniques such as angle resolved XPS, small area analysis, near ambient pressure XPS, valence XPS, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.},

A survey of the fundamental physical quantities for the electron–solid interaction is presented and sources for these quantities in the literature as well as semi-empirical formulae are given. The theoretical approaches used to describe multiple scattering in solids are outlined. These include the partial intensity approach and the continuous slowing down approximation to describe multiple energy losses and the transport approximation to tackle multiple deflections. A detailed description of the Monte Carlo technique is presented because this constitutes an effective means to study transport processes. The different theoretical approaches are illustrated in a survey of applications. These include: quantitative description of the surface sensitivity in Auger and photoelectron spectroscopy; line shape analysis of electron spectra; extracting information on the compositional depth profile from the combined energy/angular distribution in an electron spectrum; quasi-elastic electron reflection; inelastic electron backscattering; depth distribution of production of x-rays caused by electron bombardment; and the surface sensitivity in total electron yield electron spectroscopy. These applications demonstrate that the outlined approaches have a broad field of application, not only for electrons with energies ranging from thermal to the relativistic energy range, but also for other microbeam analysis techniques.

However, experiment XPS measurements alone fail to provide atomic structures from a deeply buried SEI, leaving vital details missing. By combining hybrid ab initio and reactive molecular dynamics (HAIR) and machine learning (ML) models, we present an artificial intelligence ab initio (AI-ai) framework to predict the XPS of a SEI. A localized high-concentration electrolyte with a Li metal anode is simulated with a HAIR scheme for ∼3 ns. Taking the local many-body tensor representation as a descriptor, four ML models are utilized to predict the core level shifts. Overall, extreme gradient boosting exhibits the highest accuracy and lowest variance (with errors ≤ 0.05 eV). Such an AI-ai model enables the XPS predictions of ten thousand frames with marginal cost.},

	abstract = {With the aim of developing a fast yet accurate algorithm for compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction of natural images, we combine in this paper the merits of two existing categories of CS methods: the structure insights of traditional optimization-based methods and the speed of recent network-based ones. Specifically, we propose a novel structured deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net, which is inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA)for optimizing a general ℓ1 norm CS reconstruction model. To cast ISTA into deep network form, we develop an effective strategy to solve the proximal mapping associated with the sparsity-inducing regularizer using nonlinear transforms. All the parameters in ISTA-Net (e.g. nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step sizes, etc.) are learned end-to-end, rather than being hand-crafted. Moreover, considering that the residuals of natural images are more compressible, an enhanced version of ISTA-Net in the residual domain, dubbed ISTA-Net+, is derived to further improve CS reconstruction. Extensive CS experiments demonstrate that the proposed ISTA-Nets outperform existing state-of-the-art optimization-based and networkbased CS methods by large margins, while maintaining fast computational speed.

However, few classic penalties have been selected in most applications without exploring the performance of other non-convex penalties. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide a comparative and comprehensive study on non-convex penalties. We first collected nine representative non-convex penalties and then applied two optimization frameworks: the difference of convex function algorithm (DCA) and iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to solve the optimization problems associated with the nine non-convex penalties. The performances of the nine penalties and two algorithms were systematically compared and analyzed experimentally. We hope that these results that concern non-convex penalty selection in sparse representation models can be used as a general reference for research.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is becoming very modern, and the support of Internet of Things (IoT) is inevitable in a personal healthcare system. A typical personal healthcare system acquires vital parameters from human users and stores them in a cloud platform for further analysis. Acquiring fundamental biomedical signal, such as with the Electrocardiograph (ECG), is also considered for specific disease analysis in personal healthcare systems. When such systems are scaled up, there is a heavy demand for internet channel capacity to accommodate real time seamless flow of discrete samples of biomedical signals. So, there is a keen need for real time data compression of biomedical signals. Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently attracted more interest due to its compactness and its feature of the faithful reconstruction of signals from fewer linear measurements, which facilitates less than Shannon’s sampling rate by exploiting the signal sparsity. The most common biomedical signal that is to be analyzed is the ECG signal, as the prediction of heart failure at an early stage can save a human life. This review is for a vast use-case of IoT framework in which CS measurements of ECG are acquired, communicated through Internet to a server, and the arrhythmia are analyzed using Machine learning (ML). Assuming this use-case specific for ECG, in this review many technical aspects are considered regarding various research components. The key aspect is on the investigation of the best sensing method, and to address this, various sensing matrices are reviewed, analyzed and recommended. The next aspect is the selection of the optimal sparsifying method, and the review recommends unexplored ECG compression algorithms as sparsifying methods. The other aspects are optimum reconstruction algorithms, best hardware implementations, suitable ML methods and effective modality of IoT. In this review all these components are considered, and a detailed review is presented which enables us to orchestrate the use-case specified above. This review focuses on the current trends in CS algorithms for ECG signal compression and its hardware implementation. The key to successful reconstruction of the CS method is the right selection of sensing and sparsifying matrix, and there are many unexplored sparsifying methods for the ECG signal. In this review, we shed some light on new possible sparsifying techniques. A detailed comparison table of various CS algorithms, sensing matrix, sparsifying techniques with different ECG dataset is tabulated to quantify the capability of CS in terms of appropriate performance metrics. As per the use-case specified above, the CS reconstructed ECG signals are to be subjected to ML analysis, and in this review the compressive domain inference approach is discussed. The various datasets, methodologies and ML models for ECG applications are studied and their model accuracies are tabulated. Mostly, the previous research on CS had studied the performance of CS using numerical simulation, whereas there are some good attempts for hardware implementations for ECG applications, and we studied the uniqueness of each method and supported the study with a comparison table. As a consolidation, we recommend new possibilities of the research components in terms of new transforms, new sparsifying methods, suggestions for ML approaches and hardware implementation.},

	abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) is a mathematically elegant tool for reducing the sensor sampling rate, potentially bringing context-awareness to a wider range of devices. Nevertheless, practical issues with the sampling and reconstruction algorithms prevent further proliferation of CS in real world domains, especially among heterogeneous ubiquitous devices. Deep learning (DL) naturally complements CS for adapting the sampling matrix, reconstructing the signal, and learning from the compressed samples. While the CS–DL integration has received substantial research interest recently, it has not yet been thoroughly surveyed, nor has any light been shed on practical issues towards bringing the CS–DL to real world implementations in the ubiquitous computing domain. In this paper we identify main possible ways in which CS and DL can interplay, extract key ideas for making CS–DL efficient, outline major trends in the CS–DL research space, and derive guidelines for the future evolution of CS–DL within the ubiquitous computing domain.},

	abstract = {Learning to optimize (L2O) is an emerging approach that leverages machine learning to develop optimization methods, aiming at reducing the laborious iterations of hand engineering. It automates the design of an optimization method based on its performance on a set of training problems. This data-driven procedure generates methods that can efficiently solve problems similar to those in the training. In sharp contrast, the typical and traditional designs of optimization methods are theory-driven, so they obtain performance guarantees over the classes of problems specified by the theory. The difference makes L2O suitable for repeatedly solving a certain type of optimization problems over a specific distribution of data, while it typically fails on out-of-distribution problems. The practicality of L2O depends on the type of target optimization, the chosen architecture of the method to learn, and the training procedure. This new paradigm has motivated a community of researchers to explore L2O and report their findings. This article is poised to be the first comprehensive survey and benchmark of L2O for continuous optimization. We set up taxonomies, categorize existing works and research directions, present insights, and identify open challenges. We also benchmarked many existing L2O approaches on a few but representative optimization problems. For reproducible research and fair benchmarking purposes, we released our software implementation and data in the package Open-L2O at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Open-L2O.},

	abstract = {Compressive Sensing (CS) is a new sensing modality, which compresses the signal being acquired at the time of sensing. Signals can have sparse or compressible representation either in original domain or in some transform domain. Relying on the sparsity of the signals, CS allows us to sample the signal at a rate much below the Nyquist sampling rate. Also, the varied reconstruction algorithms of CS can faithfully reconstruct the original signal back from fewer compressive measurements. This fact has stimulated research interest toward the use of CS in several fields, such as magnetic resonance imaging, high-speed video acquisition, and ultrawideband communication. This paper reviews the basic theoretical concepts underlying CS. To bridge the gap between theory and practicality of CS, different CS acquisition strategies and reconstruction approaches are elaborated systematically in this paper. The major application areas where CS is currently being used are reviewed here. This paper also highlights some of the challenges and research directions in this field.},

Empirically, this approach has often led to improved results, but theoretical guarantees are still scarce. While some progress on generalization properties of neural networks have been made, great challenges remain. In this chapter, we discuss and combine these topics to present a generalization error analysis for a class of neural networks suitable for sparse reconstruction from few linear measurements. The hypothesis class considered is inspired by the classical iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (ISTA). The neural networks in this class are obtained by unfolding iterations of ISTA and learning some of the weights. Based on training samples, we aim at learning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and thereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive linear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is shared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for dictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization bound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis classes consisting of such deep networks via Dudley's integral. Remarkably, under realistic conditions, the generalization error scales only logarithmically in the number of layers, and at most linear in number of measurements.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel sparse signal recovery algorithm called the trainable iterative soft thresholding algorithm (TISTA). The proposed algorithm consists of two estimation units: a linear estimation unit and a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator based shrinkage unit. The error variance required in the MMSE shrinkage unit is precisely estimated from a tentative estimate of the original signal. The remarkable feature of the proposed scheme is that TISTA includes adjustable variables that control step size and the error variance for the MMSE shrinkage function. The variables are adjusted by standard deep learning techniques. The number of trainable variables of TISTA is nearly equal to the number of iteration rounds and is much smaller than that of known learnable sparse signal recovery algorithms. This feature leads to highly stable and fast training processes of TISTA. Computer experiments show that TISTA is applicable to various classes of sensing matrices, such as Gaussian matrices, binary matrices, and matrices with large condition numbers. Numerical results also demonstrate that, in many cases, TISTA provides significantly faster convergence than approximate message passing (AMP) and the learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and also outperforms orthogonal AMP in the NMSE performance.},

	abstract = {The promise of compressive sensing (CS) has been offset by two significant challenges. First, real-world data is not exactly sparse in a fixed basis. Second, current high-performance recovery algorithms are slow to converge, which limits CS to either non-real-time applications or scenarios where massive back-end computing is available. In this paper, we attack both of these challenges head-on by developing a new signal recovery framework we call DeepInverse that learns the inverse transformation from measurement vectors to signals using a deep convolutional network. When trained on a set of representative images, the network learns both a representation for the signals (addressing challenge one) and an inverse map approximating a greedy or convex recovery algorithm (addressing challenge two). Our experiments indicate that the DeepInverse network closely approximates the solution produced by state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms yet is hundreds of times faster in run time. The tradeoff for the ultrafast run time is a computationally intensive, off-line training procedure typical to deep networks. However, the training needs to be completed only once, which makes the approach attractive for a host of sparse recovery problems.},

Unlike classical data reconstruction methods in Compressive Sensing (CS), such as basis pursuit or recast as a linear programming problem and solved with Primal-Dual Interior Point Method (PDIPM), the proposed data reconstruction method is inspired by the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on image edge detection. A CNN is expected to find the nonzero positions of a sequence in the sparse domain. The proposed method trains the CNN with deep residual learning [1] and takes the Half-Mean-Squared-Error (HMSE) as the loss function. It is difficult with a CNN to get accurate amplitude of nonzero points directly, but the CNN finds the nonzero positions efficiently. When the nonzero positions are found, Lower– Upper (LU) matrix factorization with partial pivoting can be used to acquire accurate CS reconstruction. The experiments show that the proposed method operates with higher speed and reconstruction accuracy than competing methods.},

	abstract = {Compressive sensing has emerged as an area that opens new perspectives in signal acquisition and processing. It appears as an alternative to the traditional sampling theory, endeavoring to reduce the required number of samples for successful signal reconstruction. In practice, compressive sensing aims to provide saving in sensing resources, transmission, and storage capacities and to facilitate signal processing in the circumstances when certain data are unavailable. To that end, compressive sensing relies on the mathematical algorithms solving the problem of data reconstruction from a greatly reduced number of measurements by exploring the properties of sparsity and incoherence. Therefore, this concept includes the optimization procedures aiming to provide the sparsest solution in a suitable representation domain. This work, therefore, offers a survey of the compressive sensing idea and prerequisites, together with the commonly used reconstruction methods. Moreover, the compressive sensing problem formulation is considered in signal processing applications assuming some of the commonly used transformation domains, namely, the Fourier transform domain, the polynomial Fourier transform domain, Hermite transform domain, and combined time-frequency domain.},

This study aims to establish the effectiveness of both techniques in identifying binary adulteration in CPRO. Three adulteration scenarios were investigated: a) CPRO and refined rapeseed oil (RRO); b) CPRO and refined sunflower oil (RSO); and c) CPRO and RRO or RSO. A range of classification techniques were trialled as well as partial least squares regression to gauge predictive quantification performance. The 400 MHz NMR achieved classification rates of 100\% in the scenarios with a single adulterant, and 93\% in the multiple adulterant scenario.

However, the compound identification in NMR spectra of mixtures is highly challenging because of chemical shift variations of the same compound in different mixtures and peak overlapping among molecules. Here, we present a pseudo-Siamese convolutional neural network method (pSCNN) to identify compounds in mixtures for NMR spectroscopy. A data augmentation method was implemented for the superposition of several NMR spectra sampled from a spectral database with random noises. The augmented dataset was split and used to train, validate and test the pSCNN model. Two experimental NMR datasets (flavor mixtures and additional flavor mixture) were acquired to benchmark its performance in real applications. The results show that the proposed method can achieve good performances in the augmented test set (ACC = 99.80\%, TPR = 99.70\% and FPR = 0.10\%), the flavor mixtures dataset (ACC = 97.62\%, TPR = 96.44\% and FPR = 2.29\%) and the additional flavor mixture dataset (ACC = 91.67\%, TPR = 100.00\% and FPR = 10.53\%). We have demonstrated that the translational invariance of convolutional neural networks can solve the chemical shift variation problem in NMR spectra. In summary, pSCNN is an off-the-shelf method to identify compounds in mixtures for NMR spectroscopy because of its accuracy in compound identification and robustness to chemical shift variation.},

	abstract = {The production of ethanol, from glucose in batch and fed batch culture, was investigated. In the fed batch culture, the glucose feeding was added into the culture at 16 th hour of fermentation. The effects of different glucose concentration feeding rates on ethanol fermentation were investigated for fed batch culture. The 2gL-1 hr-1 glucose concentration feeding rate was found to give higher ethanol yield (2.47 g ethanol g glucose-1), with respect to substrate consumed as compared to 8 gL-1 hr-1 (0.23 g ethanol g glucose-1) and 4 gL-1 hr-1 (0.20 g ethanol g glucose-1). The ethanol yield with respect to substrate consumed obtained in batch culture was 0.81 g ethanol g glucose-1. The fed batch culture at 2 gL-1 hr-1 glucose concentration feeding rate was proven to be a better fermentation system than the batch culture. The specific growth rate, specific glucose consumption rate and specific ethanol production rate for the fed batch fermentation, at 2 gL-1 hr-1 glucose concentration feeding rate, were 0.065 hr-1 , 1.20 hr-1 and 0.0009 hr-1 , respectively.},

	abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report examines the benefits of diagnosing Alzheimer's earlier in the disease process, in the stage of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. An estimated 5.7 million Americans have Alzheimer's dementia. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. In 2015, official death certificates recorded 110,561 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Between 2000 and 2015, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased, whereas deaths from AD increased 123\%. In 2017, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.4 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at more than \$232 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with Alzheimer's or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2018 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with dementia are estimated to be \$277 billion. With the identification of AD biomarkers in recent years, our understanding of the disease has moved from one based on symptoms to one based on brain changes. Because these changes begin well before clinical symptoms arise, Alzheimer's has the potential to be diagnosed before the dementia stage. Early diagnosis of AD could have important personal and financial benefits. A mathematical model estimates that early and accurate diagnosis could save up to \$7.9 trillion in medical and care costs.},

Although initially found to be equally effective as the classic KD, use of the MCTD declined because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects such as cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting. Recently, we have used the MCTD in more than 50 patients. We have found excellent seizure control, similar to the classic KD, and with careful monitoring, we have encountered minimal side effects. The MCTD should remain a viable dietary option for children with refractory epilepsy who have large appetites, can tolerate more calories, or cannot accept the restrictions of the classic KD.},

	abstract = {The stability of microencapsulated fish oil prepared using various drying methods is investigated. The fish oil with ratio of 33/22, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is emulsified with four combinations of matrices, and emulsions are dried by spray granulation (SG), spray drying (SD), and freeze drying (FD) to produce 25\% oil powders. The objective is to identify the most critical factors to determine powder stability and to further examine the superiority of the SG process compared to other drying processes. The stability is examined by measurement of peroxide values (PV) and GC-headspace propanal after 8-week’s storage at room temperature (±21°C) The best matrices are a combination of 10\% soybean soluble polysaccharide (SSPS) and 65\% octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA-starch). Microencapsulation of 620mg/g omega−3 fish oil with these matrices then dried by SG is able to produce powder having a very low propanal content and with a shelf life of 5weeks at ±21°C. The results indicate that microcapsules produced by SG are actually formed firstly by agglomeration of seed particles. These agglomerated particles are then covered by successive layers. The particle enlargement is determined by mechanism of the layer growth. Therefore, the SG process produces “multiple encapsulations” granules which provide maximum protection to the oil droplets. Comparison of the SG, SD, and FD processes confirms that combination of matrices, drying temperature, microcapsule morphology, and processing time are among the most critical factors governing stability. Exposure to heat is proved to be a limiting factor for drying unstable emulsion.},

	abstract = {Lipophilic bioactive components (LBCs) including fish oil, phytosterols, and limonene, have beneficial effect on human health. However, their hydrophobic nature and susceptibility to oxidation, light and heat limit their application in most food systems. The aim of this study was to develop a stable delivery system in microcapsule form for LBCs, especially fish oil, by coencapsulation with phytosterol esters (PE) and limonene using food-grade emulsifiers. As the first step, formation of the emulsion was studied to obtain a stable and submicron-size emulsion system. This was achieved by studying the effect of homogeniser conditions, types and composition of emulsifier, solid content and oil/emulsifier ratios on the physicochemical properties and stability of the fish oil emulsions. Milk proteins including whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCA) were studied as they were reported to have surface active properties and excellent oxygen barrier. Results show that WPI was more suitable to be applied as the main emulsifier in current research than NaCA, since its solubility was not influenced by pH. WPI could also be applied at high concentration due to its low viscosity. Mixed WPI and NaCA in a ratio of 4:1 and WPI and soluble corn fiber (SCF) in a ratio of 1:1 produced submicron emulsions with high stability. The combination of emulsifiers including maltrodextrins DE 10, DE 18, and gum Arabic could not give stable and monomodal distribution emulsions. A physical blend of WPI with SCF or NaCA together in water was the best order of addition preparation of emulsion with high stability and good properties. The order of lecithin addition, either in an aqueous or oil phase, did not show any positive effect on the emulsion properties and stability. The oxidative stability of fish oil was promoted by emulsification and was further improved by the addition of phytosterol esters. Fishy odour was successfully masked by the incorporation of limonene in the formulation. Based on the results of emulsion properties, a composition of 75 \% fish oil, 12.5 \% phytosterol esters and 12.5 \% limonene was chosen as the composition for the oil phase. The microstructure of selected emulsions was studied by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Results revealed that the emulsions had a large polydisperse spherical structure at the droplet interface and dispersion of small polydisperse spheres in solution. The emulsions stabilized by different emulsifiers showed relatively different structures at the interface while various forms and size of free emulsifiers were presented in solution. To some extent, the different microstructures of the emulsions reflect differences in properties and stability. Secondly, the emulsion systems with optimum properties and stability were dried into powder form using spray drying and freeze drying methods. Physicochemical properties of microcapsules, including water activity, glass transition temperature, microencapsulation efficiency and microstructure were investigated after the drying processes. Storage stability and in vitro digestibility of microcapsules were also investigated. Results from the physicochemical properties of microcapsules show that spray drying was the more suitable method for drying the emulsions compared with freeze drying. The spray dried microcapsules also had higher retention of limonene and lower formation of limonene oxide during storage. Among the spray-dried samples, the samples containing mixed milk proteins as wall materials gave slightly higher protection against oil oxidation compared with samples containing WPI and SCF. The results could be explained by the thicker interfacial layer around the oil droplets and the lower oxygen permeability of milk proteins. The study of interaction between wall components using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that as there was a shift of the amide II band, conjugates from a Maillard reaction possibly occurred in the protein and carbohydrate system during processing. This could be the reason that wall materials containing WPI and SCF had antioxidant properties and a slower release of oil during in vitro digestion. On application to the real food systems, including juice, ice cream and yoghurt, WPI/SCFmicrocapsules (containing the amount of 50 mg EPA+DHA per serve) showed similar properties to those samples formulated with the commercial product, namely ROPUFA® during storage. The results suggest that these newly developed co-encapsulated microcapsules would be well suited to a commercial product. Overall, this research showed that co-encapsulation of fish oil with PE and limonene can be achieved through drying. The microcapsules were shown to have reasonably good properties and could be applied in new food products.},

Similarly, a fragment of amyloid protein, Aβ$_{\textrm{1–42}}$, is lethal to hippocampal cells, producing recent memory deficits characteristic of Alzheimer9s disease. Here we show that addition of 4 mM d-β-hydroxybutyrate protected cultured mesencephalic neurons from MPP$^{\textrm{+}}$ toxicity and hippocampal neurons from Aβ$_{\textrm{1–42}}$ toxicity. Our previous work in heart showed that ketone bodies, normal metabolites, can correct defects in mitochondrial energy generation. The ability of ketone bodies to protect neurons in culture suggests that defects in mitochondrial energy generation contribute to the pathophysiology of both brain diseases.

Experiments were planned according a 22 rotational central composite design. The independent variables were oil concentration with respect to total solids (10–25\%) and homogenization pressure (0–100 MPa). Emulsions were analyzed for droplet mean diameter, stability, and viscosity, and particles were analyzed for oil retention, moisture content, particle size, and morphology. Emulsion viscosity was not affected by any of the independent variables. The increase in the homogenization pressure from 0 to 100 MPa resulted in smaller emulsion droplet size (down to 0.40 µm) and, consequently, higher oil retention (up to 95\%). On the other hand, higher oil loads (25\%) resulted in poorer oil retention (51.22\%). Microencapsulation of basil essential oil using gum arabic as the wall material proved to be a suitable process to obtain powdered basil essential oil, presenting great oil retention with the use of lower oil concentration and higher homogenization pressure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by early and region-specific declines in cerebral glucose metabolism. Ketone bodies are produced by the body during glucose deprivation and are metabolized by the brain. An oral ketogenic compound, AC-1202, was tested in subjects with probable AD to examine if ketosis could improve cognitive performance.
METHODS: Daily administration of AC-1202 was evaluated in 152 subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate AD in a US-based, 90-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were on a normal diet and continued taking approved AD medications. Primary cognitive end points were mean change from Baseline in the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and global scores in the AD Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). AC-1202 was compared to Placebo in several population groups, including: intention-to-treat (ITT), per protocol, and dosage compliant groups. Results were also stratified by APOE4 carriage status (a predefined analysis based on the epsilon 4 (E4) variant of the apolipoprotein E gene). This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, registry number NCT00142805, information available at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00142805
RESULTS: AC-1202 significantly elevated a serum ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) 2 hours after administration when compared to Placebo. In each of the population groups, a significant difference was found between AC-1202 and Placebo in mean change from Baseline in ADAS-Cog score on Day 45: 1.9 point difference, p = 0.0235 in ITT; 2.53 point difference, p = 0.0324 in per protocol; 2.6 point difference, p = 0.0215 in dosage compliant. Among participants who did not carry the APOE4 allele (E4(-)), a significant difference was found between AC-1202 and Placebo in mean change from Baseline in ADAS-Cog score on Day 45 and Day 90. In the ITT population, E4(-) participants (N = 55) administered AC-1202 had a significant 4.77 point difference in mean change from Baseline in ADAS-Cog scores at Day 45 (p = 0.0005) and a 3.36 point difference at Day 90 (p = 0.0148) compared to Placebo. In the per protocol population, E4(-) participants receiving AC-1202 (N = 37) differed from placebo by 5.73 points at Day 45 (p = 0.0027) and by 4.39 points at Day 90 (p = 0.0143). In the dosage compliant population, E4(-) participants receiving AC-1202 differed from placebo by 6.26 points at Day 45 (p = 0.0011, N = 38) and 5.33 points at Day 90 (p = 0.0063, N = 35). Furthermore, a significant pharmacologic response was observed between serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and change in ADAS-Cog scores in E4(-) subjects at Day 90 (p = 0.008). Adverse events occurred more frequently in AC-1202 subjects, were primarily restricted to the gastrointestinal system, and were mainly mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature.
CONCLUSION: AC-1202 rapidly elevated serum ketone bodies in AD patients and resulted in significant differences in ADAS-Cog scores compared to the Placebo. Effects were most notable in APOE4(-) subjects who were dosage compliant.},

To evaluate the glycemic and breath hydrogen responses and gastrointestinal tolerance to pullulan, nondiabetic healthy adult subjects (n = 28) were studied in a randomized, double-masked, crossover design. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed beverages containing 50 g of carbohydrate from either maltodextrin (control) or pullulan. Capillary blood glucose response was determined for 180 min postprandially. Breath hydrogen response was determined for 8 h postprandially. Compared with control, incremental peak blood glucose concentration was reduced (P {\textless} 0.01) when subjects consumed pullulan (4.24 +/- 0.35 vs. 1.97 +/- 0.10 mmol/L). In addition, pullulan reduced (P {\textless} 0.01) the positive incremental area under the glucose curve by 50\%. When subjects consumed pullulan, the incremental blood glucose excursions were reduced (P {\textless} 0.01) at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min, but were maintained above basal glucose concentrations at 150 and 180 min. At 180 min, the blood glucose concentration was higher (P {\textless} 0.05) when subjects consumed pullulan compared with control, supporting the hypothesis that pullulan is digested slowly. Breath hydrogen concentrations were increased (P {\textless} 0.01) at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h postprandially when subjects consumed pullulan. In the first 24-h postprandial period, the frequency and intensity of flatulence was higher (P {\textless} 0.05) after subjects consumed pullulan compared with control. In conclusion, pullulan attenuated the postprandial glycemic excursion compared with an equivalent maltodextrin challenge. Pullulan also increased breath hydrogen excretion and the incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance symptoms, indicating that a portion of pullulan was malabsorbed.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To conduct the first randomized trial on classical and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) versions of the ketogenic diet, examining efficacy and tolerability after 3, 6, and 12 months. Methods: One hundred forty-five children with intractable epilepsy were randomized to receive a classical or an MCT diet. Seizure frequency was assessed after 3, 6, and 12 months. Treatment withdrawals were documented. Tolerability was assessed by questionnaire, and blood ketone levels were measured. Results: Of the 61 children who started a classical diet and the 64 who started an MCT diet, data from 94 were available for analysis: 45 classical and 49 MCT. After 3, 6, and 12 months there were no statistically significant differences in mean percentage of baseline seizures between the two groups (3 months: classical 66.5\%, MCT 68.9\%; 6 months: classical 48.5\%, MCT 67.6\%; 12 months: classical 40.8\%, MCT 53.2\%; all p {\textgreater} 0.05). There were no significant differences between groups in numbers achieving greater than 50\% or 90\% seizure reduction. Serum acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate levels at 3 and 6 months were significantly higher in children on the classical diet (p {\textless} 0.01); this was the case at 12 months for acetoacetate. There were no significant differences in tolerability except increased reports in the classical group of lack of energy after 3 months and vomiting after 12 months. Discussion: This study has shown classical and MCT ketogenic diet protocols to be comparable in efficacy and tolerability; both ways of implementing the diet have their place in the treatment of childhood epilepsy.},

Good emulsifying activity was demonstrated for gum arabic, whereas fine emulsions could not be produced from the other polysaccharide solutions and oil. Frequency-dependent increases in the storage and loss moduli were observed for all the polysaccharide solutions. Such rheological behavior did not substantially change when maltodextrin and pullulan were mixed with oil to form emulsions. However, the frequency-dependence of the dynamic moduli disappeared in the gum arabic-stabilized emulsion, suggesting the formation of a network structure in which oil droplets could form junctions with gum arabic chains.

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}BACKGROUND{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}As the world population ages, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration become ever more prevalent. Interventions that favor healthy aging would constitute powerful strategies with which to limit human diseases that have a broad socioeconomic impact. Fasting regimens such as intermittent fasting or dietary adaptations such as caloric restriction are among the few regimens that extend life and beneficially affect health in all tested model organisms, including rodents and nonhuman primates. However, few people seem capable of changing their dietary routines for extended periods. Thus, supplementation with caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs), which would pharmacologically mimic the beneficial effects of caloric restriction or fasting, has gained attention as an attractive and potentially feasible strategy. The naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, the abundance of which declines during the process of aging, has emerged as a well-tolerable CRM targeting various molecular and physiological age-associated adversities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ADVANCES{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Conceptually, healthy aging requires the retardation of multiple molecular and cellular alterations that drive the aging process and induce age-associated pathologies. These include genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, loss of protein degradation capacity (leading to neurodegeneration), deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, and chronic inflammation. Spermidine displays pleiotropic effects that include anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant functions, enhancement of mitochondrial metabolic function and respiration, as well as improved proteostasis and chaperone activity. Many anti-aging effects of spermidine are causally connected to the capacity of this polyamine to induce cytoprotective autophagy. Autophagy ensures general cell homeostasis and proteostasis and is directly involved in the degradation of damaged, potentially toxic organelles and harmful protein aggregates, thus removing and recycling cytoplasmic material that otherwise would accumulate during aging. Consistently, extra supply of spermidine prolongs the life span across species in an autophagy-dependent manner and counteracts age-associated pathologies such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. For instance, dietary spermidine supplementation ameliorates age-induced memory impairment in flies and protects from autoimmune-directed demyelination of neurons in a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. Spermidine also reduces the growth of transplantable tumors, stimulates anticancer immune surveillance in combination with chemotherapy, and suppresses tumorigenesis induced by chemical insults in mice. Moreover, elevated dietary polyamine uptake correlates with reduced cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality in human epidemiological studies. Because spermidine is already present in daily human nutrition, clinical trials aiming at increasing the uptake of this polyamine appear feasible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}OUTLOOK{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Although spermidine induces autophagy and autophagy inhibition curtails many of the health-promoting effects of spermidine, additional mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of spermidine on aging. These potentially autophagy-independent mechanisms include direct antioxidant and metabolic effects on arginine bioavailability and nitric oxide (NO) production. However, it has not been formally determined whether these routes act in a completely autophagy-independent manner or are interrelated with autophagy (in an additive or synergistic way) (see the figure), and it will be important to define actionable molecular targets that explain the beneficial effects of spermidine in diverse pathophysiological settings. In this sense, it will also be of interest to explore synergisms of spermidine with other CRMs that initially act through different mechanisms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Another unresolved enigma resides in the tissue specificity of spermidine-induced health effects. For instance, the mechanisms through which oral spermidine intake can mediate systemic effects on blood metabolites and proteins remain to be elucidated. Similarly, it remains elusive whether spermidine acts exclusively on leukocytes to suppress chronic low-grade inflammation, and to what degree other organs may explain the increased bioavailability of arginine upon spermidine supplementation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}One strong argument in favor of the exploration of spermidine as a CRM in clinical trials is its low toxicity yet strong efficacy. Spermidine is an abundant natural polyamine contained in all organisms from bacteria to men and is naturally present in reasonable but varying amounts in human diets. Nevertheless, based on preclinical results, possible contraindications of spermidine administration such as advanced cancer and renal failure have to be defined. Last, it may be interesting to explore the development of artificial spermidine analogs with increased potency or ameliorated pharmacokinetic characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the glycemic, insulinemic, and breath hydrogen responses to food starch esterified with 1-octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) and glucose in 22 healthy nondiabetic adults. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were analyzed at baseline and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes postprandially. Breath hydrogen excretion was measured at baseline and at hourly intervals for 8 hours after the carbohydrate challenge. Peak plasma glucose concentration was reduced 8\% (P {\textless} 0.03) and peak insulin concentration was decreased 28\% (P {\textless} 0.004) after subjects consumed the OSA beverage compared with the glucose beverage. Similarly, OSA reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) the area under the curve (0–120 min) for both plasma glucose and insulin. The increase in the number of positive breath hydrogen tests with the OSA-substituted starch suggests that the lowered glycemic response is at least partially due to malabsorption of OSA by the small intestine.},

The underlying pathology of Alzheimer's is not yet fully understood, so existing research has focused on understanding the prominent features of the disease. These include amyloid plaques, which accumulate in the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease, impaired glucose metabolism, and neuronal cell death. Emerging evidence suggests that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet may help to mitigate the damage associated with these pathologies. The ketogenic diet could alleviate the impact of impaired glucose metabolism by providing ketones as a supplementary energy source. Additionally, this diet may help to reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques, while reversing amyloid beta toxicity. Research has begun to identify early underlying mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease that could be targeted by new prevention strategies. Glycation of the ApoE protein leads to impaired transportation of important lipids including cholesterol to the brain, resulting in lipid deficiencies that could explain progression to the later pathologies of the disease. We hypothesize that the ketogenic diet could be an effective treatment and prevention for AD, but both ketone production and carbohydrate restriction may be needed to achieve this.},

Spray drying is based on the preparation, homogenization, atomization, dispersion and subsequently dehydration of the solution. Wall deposition is a key processing problem in the spray dryer particles that indirectly affects the quality and quantity of the product. The degree of wall deposition is affected by several factors including operating parameters, type and size of spray dryer and the spray dryer wall properties. The development of wall depositions in the spray dryer deteriorates the yield of the products and hence increases the costs of manufacturing and maintenance. And constructive models are very resourceful in understanding the mechanism of wall deposition which will result in direct economic benefits to the food industry. The aim of this review is to give a physical and chemical description of the wall deposition mechanism and introduce the classified models to simulate and visualize this behavior in spray dryers.},

As a metabolic disorder involving the dysregulation of glycolysis and respiration, malignant brain cancer is potentially manageable through changes in metabolic environment. A radically different approach to brain cancer management is proposed that combines metabolic control analysis with the evolutionarily conserved capacity of normal cells to survive extreme shifts in physiological environment. In contrast to malignant brain tumors that are largely dependent on glycolysis for energy, normal neurons and glia readily transition to ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate) for energy in vivo when glucose levels are reduced. The bioenergetic transition from glucose to ketone bodies metabolically targets brain tumors through integrated anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic mechanisms. The approach focuses more on the genomic flexibility of normal cells than on the genomic defects of tumor cells and is supported from recent studies in orthotopic mouse brain tumor models and in human pediatric astrocytoma treated with dietary energy restriction and the ketogenic diet.},

Metabolic control theory applies principles of bioenergetics and genome flexibility to the management of complex phenotypic traits. Epilepsy is a complex brain disorder involving excessive, synchronous, abnormal electrical firing patterns of neurons. We propose that many epilepsies with varied etiologies may ultimately involve disruptions of brain energy homeostasis and are potentially manageable through principles of metabolic control theory. This control involves moderate shifts in the availability of brain energy metabolites (glucose and ketone bodies) that alter energy metabolism through glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively. These shifts produce adjustments in gene-linked metabolic networks that manage or control the seizure disorder despite the continued presence of the inherited or acquired factors responsible for the epilepsy. This hypothesis is supported by information on the management of seizures with diets including fasting, the ketogenic diet and caloric restriction. A better understanding of the compensatory genetic and neurochemical networks of brain energy metabolism may produce novel antiepileptic therapies that are more effective and biologically friendly than those currently available.},

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, which typically begins with deterioration in memory. Before death, individuals with this disorder have usually become dependent on caregivers. The neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques—which are frequently surrounded by dystrophic neurites—and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These hallmark pathologies are often accompanied by the presence of reactive microgliosis and the loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying the neuropathological changes in AD remain unclear, but are probably affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we provide an overview of the criteria used in the diagnosis of AD, highlighting how this disease is related to, but distinct from, normal aging. We also summarize current information relating to AD prevalence, incidence and risk factors, and review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Background
The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning.
Methods
In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980–2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged ≥60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions.
Results
Age-standardized prevalence for those aged ≥60 years varied in a narrow band, 5\%–7\% in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5\%), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2\%–4\%). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58\% of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63\% in 2030 and 71\% in 2050.
Conclusion
The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression). All countries need to commission nationally representative surveys that are repeated regularly to monitor trends.},

Emulsion (20 wt\% oil) stabilized by whey protein (1 wt\%) was thermally cross-linked at 82 °C for 10 min and spray dried without any additional wall materials using inlet/outlet air temperature of 105 ± 2/65 ± 2 °C, respectively at a pilot scale. Confocal micrograph showed cohesive cross-linked whey protein film present at the oil-water interface and at the powder surface stabilising the oil powder particles containing 95.3 wt\% oil. The mean droplet size of parent emulsion (0.21, 0.38, 0.76, 2.31 μm) significantly influenced the mechanical stability of the resulting oil powder in terms of oil leakage (2.73, 0.93, 4.1, 7.54 wt\%) upon compaction. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the level of surface oil and porous “sponge” like internal microstructure of the oil powder with polyhedral, closely packed droplets. Strong correlations existed between the mechanical properties of the oil powder and the oxidative stability over 5 months. The kinetics of oxidation of oil powder was higher than that of corresponding bulk oil with or without added antioxidants as evidenced by evolution of primary oxidation products (hydroperoxides) and secondary oxidation products (hexanal). This might be due to the multi-step processing (e.g. homogenization, thermal cross-linking, spray drying) as well as inability of the cohesive but permeable protein matrix to protect the ultra-high content of oil droplets from diffusion of oxygen and prooxidants.},

Over the shear rate range investigated (∼1–103s−1), gluten had a substantially lower viscosity than the other two proteins, although the difference was less pronounced at the highest temperature studied. This low viscosity is reflected by lower values of the glass transition temperature, the melt flow temperature and the dynamic moduli E′ and E″ in the rubbery state.

Digestibility and physical properties of the products were measured. For waxy corn starch, combinations of crosslinking (CL) followed by stabilization via hydroxypropylation (HP) or acetylation (AC) produced more SDS than did crosslinking alone; CL-HP produced the highest content of slowly digestible starch (SDS, ∼21\%), while CL-AC produced the highest content of resistant starch (RS, ∼24\%). CL-HP (prepared without salt in the reaction mixture) and hydroxypropylation (with NaCl in the reaction mixture) followed by crosslinking (HP-CL) had similar SDS contents, but HP-CL had a higher RS content, indicating that the presence of salt as well as the order of modification could affect digestibility of the modified starch. Esterification with 2-octen-1-ylsuccinic anhydride (OSA) was the most effective of the modifications used for increasing both SDS and RS. Dry heating (130°C) of OSA waxy corn starch increased the SDS content and decreased RS content. OSA starches had lower pasting temperatures and higher peak viscosities than their native counterparts. Dry heating of OSA starches resulted in even lower pasting temperatures. Peak viscosities were higher for heated OSA waxy corn and tapioca starches, but lower for heated OSA normal corn and potato starches as compared to unheated octenylsuccinylated starches. To, Tp, and gelatinization enthalpy (ΔH) decreased in the order native waxy corn starch{\textgreater}OSA waxy corn starch{\textgreater}heated OSA waxy corn starch.

	abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study was to compare the ketogenic effect of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α stimulator, bezafibrate (BEZA), alone or in combination with medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) in healthy adults.
Methods
Eighteen healthy adults completed the study: 10 were given a therapeutic dose of BEZA (400 mg/d) for 8 wk followed by a further 4 wk of BEZA (400 mg/d) plus MCT (60 g/d). Eight other participants were given MCT alone (60 g/d) for 4 wk. All participants underwent identical metabolic study days: (a) pretreatment (the control), and after (b) BEZA combined with MCT (BEZA+MCT) or (c) an equal dose of MCT only. On the metabolic study days, a standard breakfast and lunch were given and blood samples were taken hourly to measure plasma ketones, glucose, and fatty acids.
Results
The combination of BEZA+MCT increased ketones twofold during the metabolic study day. The addition of BEZA increased early ketogenic efficiency of MCT by 2.5-fold but did not result in higher peak or mean concentration of ketones during the metabolic study day. No other differences were seen in plasma metabolites or insulin during metabolic study days. On the final metabolic study day, MCT or BEZA+MCT had different effects on the plasma acetoacetate-to-β-hydroxybutyrate ratio compared with control.
Conclusions
BEZA mildly potentiated the ketogenic action of MCT but did not increase peak plasma ketone concentration or overall ketone production during the metabolic study day.},

Heat treatment of the encapsulants and exposure of microcapsules to simulated gastric fluid (SGF) prior to addition of lipase, trypsin and amylase altered the susceptibility of the microcapsules to digestion. Lipolysis of microcapsules occurred in the presence of lipase alone and was increased in the presence of amylase and/or trypsin. Pre-exposure of microcapsules to SGF had different effects on lipolysis, which depended on the nature of the encapsulant material. Lipolysis in the presence of lipase alone was due to the displacement of the interfacial layer. Increased lipolysis in the presence of amylase and/or trypsin was attributed to the digestion of the encapsulant, which facilitated displacement of the interface of oil droplets by bile salts.},

The quantity of lycopene was varied at 5, 10 and 15\% in a solution containing 30\% of solids in order to obtain the microcapsules. These microcapsules were evaluated as to encapsulation efficiency and morphology and then submitted to a stability test and applied in cakes.

Acetone concentrations rise rapidly, reach a maximum several hours after ingestion of MCT and gradually return to base-line values. Under standardized conditions, ingestion of increasing amounts of MCT results in increasing acetone concentrations. Repeated tests in the same subject are reproducible within narrow limits. The acetone response is quantitatively suppressed by the administration of increasing amounts of sucrose. Maximal acetone concentrations increase with prolongation of fasting before ingestion of MCT. Three insulin-dependent diabetics had an acetone response in the MCT test 212 times greater than the mean response of 4 normal subjects. The acetone response of a thiazide-induced diabetic was normal. Interpretation of the results of MCT tests in normal subjects is that the magnitude of ketosis in man is the result of carbohydrate deficiency relative to the amount of fat entering the liver. The MCT test is a means of measuring the tendency of a subject to develop ketosis in response to a standardized fat load and may be useful for the classification of diabetes mellitus.},

Neurobiological evidence suggests that ketone bodies are an effective alternative energy substrate for the brain. Elevation of plasma ketone body levels through an oral dose of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) may improve cognitive functioning in older adults with memory disorders. On separate days, 20 subjects with AD or mild cognitive impairment consumed a drink containing emulsified MCTs or placebo. Significant increases in levels of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) were observed 90min after treatment (P=0.007) when cognitive tests were administered. β-OHB elevations were moderated by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (P=0.036). For ε4+ subjects, β-OHB levels continued to rise between the 90 and 120min blood draws in the treatment condition, while the β-OHB levels of ε4− subjects held constant (P{\textless}0.009). On cognitive testing, MCT treatment facilitated performance on the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) for ε4− subjects, but not for ε4+ subjects (P=0.04). Higher ketone values were associated with greater improvement in paragraph recall with MCT treatment relative to placebo across all subjects (P=0.02). Additional research is warranted to determine the therapeutic benefits of MCTs for patients with AD and how APOE-ε4 status may mediate β-OHB efficacy.},

In vitro digestion models show great promise in facilitating the rationale design of foods. This paper provides a look into the current state of the art and outlines possible future paths for developments of digestion models recreating the diverse physiological conditions of specific groups of the human population.
Scope and approach
Based on a collective effort of experts, this paper outlines considerations and parameters needed for development of new in vitro digestion models, e.g. gastric pH, enzymatic activities, gastric emptying rate and more. These and other parameters are detrimental to the adequate development of in vitro models that enable deeper insight into matters of food luminal breakdown as well as nutrient and nutraceutical bioaccessibility. Subsequently, we present an overview of some new and emerging in vitro digestion models mirroring the gastro-intestinal conditions of infants, the elderly and patients of cystic fibrosis or gastric bypass surgery.
Key findings and conclusions
This paper calls for synchronization, harmonization and validation of potential developments in in vitro digestion models that would greatly facilitate manufacturing of foods tailored or even personalized, to a certain extent, to various strata of the human population.},

Diverse wall materials, including some carbohydrates, preserve substances against adverse temperature, pH, humidity, oxygen, and other components that can react with the protected material. Starch is a wall material that is widely used for microencapsulation purpose. Unmodified and modified starches are increasingly considered for microencapsulation of vitamins, essential oils, flavors, drugs, and microorganisms. Recently, spherical aggregates of starch using small granules (1–3 μm) were developed for encapsulation purposes. Spherical aggregates are produced when small starch granules in the presence of additional bonding agents (e.g., proteins and hydrocolloids) are spray dried. Some studies have reported the application of spherical aggregates, but they neither report the effects of amylose content nor the molecular weight of amylopectin. In this sense, this review focuses on the state of the art of starch spherical aggregates and the perspectives of their applications as encapsulating agents.},

	abstract = {Normal corn starch was chemically modified by oxidation, acetylation, hydroxypropylation, and cross-linking, and the digestibility and glycemic indices (GI) of these modified starches were examined by in vitro hydrolysis using pancreatic α-amylase. During the early stage of hydrolysis (up to 60min) with prime (ungelatinized) starches, the modified starches were hydrolyzed at greater extents than the unmodified starches. However, at the late stage of hydrolysis (after 3h), the modified starches showed lower degrees of hydrolysis than the unmodified starch. The amount of resistant starch (RS) in prime starches were 23.4\%, 35.1\%, 34.2\%, and 13.9\% in the acetylated, oxidized, hydroxypropylated, and cross-linked starches, respectively, whereas the unmodified starch contained 11.9\%. The amount of slowly digestible starch (SDS) was decreased as the RS content was increased by the modification, indicating that some of the SDS transformed to RS. By gelatinization, all the starches, regardless of type of modification, were more quickly hydrolyzed and reached maximum levels within 20min. Like the prime starches, the modified starches contained higher contents of undigested starches after gelatinization. The modifications except cross-linking reduced rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content but increased the RS content when the starches were gelatinized. The hydroxypropylated starch had the lowest GI values, which were estimated from the hydrolysis profiles (70.6 and 86.2 in prime and gelatinized states, respectively), whereas the GI values of cross-linked starch were similar to those of the unmodified starch. Therefore, chemical substitution such as hydroxypropylation and acetylation, and oxidation can be used to reduce the starch digestibility and raise the RS content.},

The application of powders as a savory creamer showed the lack of any substantial quality changes of color caused by water hardness. The peroxide value (PV) of microencapsulated linseed oil extracted from powders stored in barrier packages was higher than the PV of a control sample of bulk oil. Adverse changes of the UFA/SFA ratio, indicating the proportion between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, were observed in oil extracted from stored powders.},

	abstract = {The degree of substitution (DS) is one of the most important properties of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-modified starch, in terms of optimizing its functionality in the application of delivery systems for lipophilic bioactive components. This study investigated the effect of the DS of OSA-modified starch on the in vitro digestion behavior and the β-carotene bioaccessibility in nanoemulsions stabilized by OSA-modified starches. Changes in the particle size and distribution, microstructure, zeta-potential, hydrolysis of the starch, and lipolysis in the emulsions during digestion as well as the bioaccessibility of β-carotene were determined. All the emulsions remained stable during the mouth stage and their particle size increased significantly after incubation under gastric conditions, with the extent of increase in the particle size being negatively correlated to the DS. Under gastric conditions, the emulsions stabilized by OSA-modified starches with higher DS values had less flocculation and coalescence, which could probably be attributed to the greater steric hindrance of branched amylopectin chains and the greater magnitudes of the negative zeta-potential in the presence of more OSA groups. The more rigid and compact surface structure formed by the OSA-modified starch with higher DS provide better protection against the biochemical conditions in the gastric fluid. When the DS increased from 0.0158 to 0.0416, the bioaccessibility of β-carotene was enhanced from 8.01 ± 0.88 to 20.39 ± 1.93\%, which may have been due to a lower extent of starch digestion and a greater extent of lipid digestion in nanoemulsions stabilized by OSA-modified starch with higher DS values.},

Finger-prick capillary blood was obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min postprandial for glucose measurement. After OSA treatment, the rise in blood glucose was reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) at 15 and 30 min and tended (P {\textless} 0.08) to be lower at 45 min. Mean peak rise in glucose was reduced 19\% (P {\textless} 0.01) by OSA (3.30 ± 0.19 versus 2.66 ± 0.16 mmol/L) compared to glucose, but time to peak did not differ between treatments. Net incremental area under the curve was also lower (P {\textless} 0.05) on OSA compared to glucose. Minimal effects on gastrointestinal symptoms (intensity and frequency of nausea, cramping, distention, and flatulence) were noted for both products, with no clinically significant difference between products. In conclusion, starch substitution with OSA attenuated the postprandial glycemic excursion compared to an equivalent glucose challenge and was well tolerated by fasting healthy adult subjects.

We measured directly the absorption of medium- and long-chain fatty acids via the mesenteric lymphatics and portal vein in normal animals. These results may be useful in guiding therapy for short-bowel syndrome.
METHODS: Under anesthesia, male Lewis rats (n = 6) underwent placement of jugular and portal venous lines, mesenteric lymphatic duct cannula, and a duodenal tube. After recovery, a 0.3\% lauric acid (C12:0) and 0.37\% palmitic acid (C16:0) solution solublized with 3.25 mmol/L lecithin and 23.75 mmol/L taurocholic acid in phosphate-buffered saline was infused at a rate of 3 mL/h via the duodenal tube. After stabilization of lymphatic flow (6 hours), a pulse of radiolabeled lauric and palmitic acid was given via the duodenal tube; absorption was measured by collection of lymphatic fluid and sampling of the portal and jugular venous blood for 4 hours.
RESULTS: The amount of acid recovered in the lymphatics was 51\% +/- 6\% (mean +/- SD) for lauric and 59\% +/- 6\% for palmitic. For both fatty acids, {\textless} 1\% in total was recovered from the portal vein during the 4-hour postbolus period; thereafter, levels in the blood were constant and very low. At necropsy, the majority of the remaining label was found in the intestine.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show no evidence for the preferential absorption of medium-chain fatty acids directly via the portal vein in this model. We suggest that further studies be done to measure directly portal vein absorption of the medium-chain fatty acids.},

	abstract = {Summary
High-fat, low-carbohydrate diets, known as ketogenic diets, have been used as a non-pharmacological treatment for refractory epilepsy. A key mechanism of this treatment is thought to be the generation of ketones, which provide brain cells (neurons and astrocytes) with an energy source that is more efficient than glucose, resulting in beneficial downstream metabolic changes, such as increasing adenosine levels, which might have effects on seizure control. However, some studies have challenged the central role of ketones because medium-chain fatty acids, which are part of a commonly used variation of the diet (the medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet), have been shown to directly inhibit AMPA receptors (glutamate receptors), and to change cell energetics through mitochondrial biogenesis. Through these mechanisms, medium-chain fatty acids rather than ketones are likely to block seizure onset and raise seizure threshold. The mechanisms underlying the ketogenic diet might also have roles in other disorders, such as preventing neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, the proliferation and spread of cancer, and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Analysing medium-chain fatty acids in future ketogenic diet studies will provide further insights into their importance in modified forms of the diet. Moreover, the results of these studies could facilitate the development of new pharmacological and dietary therapies for epilepsy and other disorders.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by decline in cognitive functions and associated with the neuropathological hallmarks of amyloid β-peptide plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Cerebral glucose uptake and metabolism deteriorate in AD and this hypometabolism precedes the onset of clinical signs in AD. The early decline in brain glucose metabolism in AD has become a potential target for therapeutic intervention. This has led to investigations assessing the supplementation of the normal glucose supply with ketone bodies which are produced by the body during glucose deprivation and can be metabolized by the brain when glucose utilization is impaired. The present review provides a synopsis of preclinical studies and clinical trials assessing the efficacy of ketogenic diets in the treatment of AD. Both the direct administration of ketone bodies and the use of high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets have been shown to be efficacious in animal models of AD and clinical trials with AD patients. The mechanism underlying the efficacy of ketogenic diets remains unclear, but some evidence points to the normalization of aberrant energy metabolism. At present there is only limited evidence of the usefulness of ketogenic diets in AD. However, this dietary approach seems to be promising and deserves further clinical investigations.},

Impaired brain glucose metabolism appears to be a potential pathogenic feature of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study examined the potential for increasing circulating ketone bodies through medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation, as a means to beneficially modulate brain homeostasis in subjects with MCI.
Methods
Six participants with MCI were enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Participants received 56g/day of either medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) or placebo for 24weeks. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, apolipoprotein-E4 status, and cognitive assessments were carried out. Due to the small number of participants only the raw scores were examined.
Results
Intake of MCT oil increased serum ketone bodies and improved memory, while intake of placebo did not show improvement in any of the cognitive measures tested.
Conclusions
Consumption of 56g/day of MCTs for 24weeks increases serum ketone concentrations and appears to be a candidate for larger randomized control trials in the future that quantify the modulation of cognitive function through supplementation with ketone precursors, in patients with MCI.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate, moderate protein, high-fat diet that has emerged as a potential treatment for autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder of social communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviors and interests in need of novel therapies. An open-label clinical trial was done in Honolulu, Hawaii to test a modified ketogenic diet for improvement of core clinical impairments in children with ASD.
Intervention
A modified ketogenic gluten-free diet regimen with supplemental MCT was completed in 15 children ages 2 to 17 years for 3 months. Clinical (ADOS-2, CARS-2) and biochemical measures were performed at baseline and 3-months on the ketogenic diet.
Main outcome
Children administered a modified ketogenic gluten-free diet with supplemental MCT significantly improved core autism features assessed from the ADOS-2 after 3 months on diet (P = 0.006). No significant difference was observed in restricted and repetitive behavior score (P = 0.125) after 3 months on the diet protocol. Substantial improvement ({\textgreater}30\% decrease ADOS-2 total score) was observed in six participants, moderate improvement ({\textgreater}3 units) in two participants, and minor/no improvement in seven participants. Ten participants assessed at a six-month time point sustained improvement in total ADOS-2 and social affect sub-domain scores comparing baseline and 6 months (P = 0.019; P = 0.023), but no significant improvement in restricted and repetitive behavior scores were noted (P = 0.197). Significant improvements in CARS-2 items after 3 months of the modified ketogenic protocol were observed in imitation, body use, and fear or nervousness (P = 0.031, P = 0.008, P = 0.039). The percent change on ADOS-2 score from baseline to 3 months was associated with baseline high-density lipoprotein levels (ρ = −0.67, P = 0.007) and albumin levels (ρ = −0.60, P = 0.019). Moreover, the percent change from baseline to 3 months in ADOS-2 scores was significantly associated with percent change in high-density lipoprotein levels (ρ = 0.54, P = 0.049) and albumin levels (ρ = 0.67, P = 0.010).
Conclusions
A modified gluten-free ketogenic diet with supplemental MCT is a potentially beneficial treatment option to improve the core features of autism spectrum disorder and warrants further investigation.

OS-starch finds wide application in the food industry mainly as emulsifier, encapsulating agent and fat replacer. As a result of the new hydrophobic groups introduced and concomitant changes produced in the granules structure, OSA modified starches typically show reduced gelatinization temperature and enthalpy, lower digestibility, higher swelling power, and increased paste viscosity and paste clarity. Traditionally, OS-starches have been synthesized in aqueous slurry under mild alkaline conditions, resulting in reaction taking place mainly on the surface and amorphous regions of starch granules. However, in the last years, alternative methodologies and modifications to the conventional method (e.g. in situ mechanical and ultrasonic assistance, and hydrothermal, mechanical, enzymatic and chemical pretreatments of starch) have received much attention; aiming to increase reaction efficiency, reduce reaction time, attain a more even distribution of ester groups within the granules, and/or produce OS-starches with enhanced or specific properties.

The influences of OSA starch, used as emulsifier, on stability, disperse and rheological properties of oil-in-water emulsions were examined in this work. The oil content in emulsions varied from 5 to 60\% and OSA starch concentrations were 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16\% expressed relative to the water mass. The obtained results showed that increase in OSA starch concentration led to decrease in mean droplets diameter (d32) and decrease in standard deviation. Also, apparent viscosity and physical stability of the systems increased with increase in OSA starch concentration. For all examined concentrations of OSA starch the increase in amount of dispersed phase caused increase in apparent viscosity and non-Newtonian behavior of emulsions became more pronounced. A significant delay of creaming at high oil concentrations in emulsions stabilized by OSA starch was noticed.},

	abstract = {Octenyl succinic anhydride modified starches (OSA-starches) are widely used as emulsifiers and stabilizers in the food industry. Selection of optimal OSA-starches for a given application would be facilitated with better understanding of the relations between performance and molecular structure, and the mechanistic reasons for observed correlations. Structural parameters, including molecular size distribution, chain-length distribution, degree of branching, degree of substitution (DS) and amount of small molecules such as maltose, were characterized using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, also termed GPC) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and were correlated with the functional properties of viscosity, emulsion droplet size and emulsion stability. The observed correlations varied with the methods used to make the OSA-starch, which affects gross structural features. The viscosity of OSA-starch solutions was related to starch molecular size and the relative amounts of small molecules; the DS showed positive correlation with viscosity. Emulsion droplet size is mainly determined by the whole molecular size of the OSA-starch. Emulsion stabilization efficacy is mainly affected by the average chain length. These correlations can be rationalized by basic precepts of the behaviour of polymer chains in solution and the fundamentals of electrosteric stabilization.},

The test characteristics included retention efficiency (RE), redispersion behavior (droplet size distribution and mean size of reconstituted emulsions) of spray-dried powders, moisture content, dissolution behavior, and microstructure of particles. The influence of storage at 75\% relative humidity for 7days on these characteristics was also investigated. The results indicated that the RE, redispersion and/or dissolution behaviors, as well as storage stability of spray-dried emulsions were affected by various test parameters, but to a various extent. Among all test parameters, the core/wall ratio was the most pronounced one affecting the properties of the powders, regardless of after storage or not. In general, the RE of the dry powders was higher at increased pressure level, decreased core/wall material, as well as enhanced total solid contents; at a constant total solid content, the redispersion behavior of these powders was closely associated with their RE. At the core/wall ratios of 1:1 or higher, the storage resulted in remarkable decreases in RE of the powders, and impaired redispersion behaviors, while the powder at 1:2 core/wall ratio exhibited an excellent storage stability. Scanning electron microscopy observations confirmed that the differences in RE or storage stability at various core/wall ratios were related to the differences in their particle microstructure. These results would be of great help to understand the microencapsulation properties of SPI, thus providing some valuable information for the development of microencapsulated products using soy proteins as the wall materials.},

All emulsions were evaluated for droplet size, viscosity, zeta potential and surface tension, while microparticles were analysed for encapsulation efficiency, oil retention, moisture content, particle mean diameter, microstructure, in vitro sun protection factor and oxidative stability by Rancimat. Critical storage conditions based on sorption isotherms and glass transition temperature and diterpenes quantification were determined for the microparticles with the highest values of encapsulation efficiency. In general, the use of 50MPa of homogenisation pressure allowed a reduction of droplet mean diameter for about 1μm, with a slight decrease on emulsion viscosity. For microparticles, there was an increase on encapsulation efficiency with the use of high pressure homogenisation. Oil retention was influenced by the type of wall material. Moisture content (2.0\%) and in vitro sun protection factor values (FPS=2.1) were similar for all emulsions and in the last case were similar to pure oil. Particle mean diameter ranged from 10.7 to 16.0μm. Powders produced with the mixture Hi-Cap/MD presented good values of critical water activity of 0.60 and critical moisture content of 0.08g/g of dry solids, respectively, and also the highest oxidative stability. High concentration of diterpenes of 0.21 and 0.24mg of kahweol/g powder, 0.19 and 0.21mg of cafestol/g powder were observed for particles produced with Hi-Cap/MD and GA/MD, with emulsions homogenised at 50MPa.},

	abstract = {In this study, the effects of wall material formula and spray drying conditions on physicochemical properties of walnut oil microcapsules were investigated. Three different wall materials including skim milk powder (SMP), SMP+Tween 80, and SMP+maltodextrin were used for emulsion preparation. The prepared emulsions were analyzed for droplet size and stability. The emulsions were then dried in a pilot-scale spray dryer equipped with a two-fluid nozzle at different inlet drying air temperatures and feed atomization pressures in order to determine the optimal drying conditions for maximizing the microencapsulation efficiency. The microencapsulation efficiency, particle size distribution, sphericity, moisture content, bulk density, and morphology of produced microcapsules were also measured experimentally. In addition, the microcapsules with the highest microencapsulation efficiency obtained from each wall material were subjected to surface coverage of oil test using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) after 60days of storage at room temperature. The emulsion prepared using SMP and Tween 80 combination as wall material resulted in the highest microencapsulation efficiency (91.01\%) at drying air temperature of 180°C and feed atomization pressure of 3bar. The lowest surface coverage of oil was also observed for microcapsules covered by SMP and Tween 80 combination. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed almost no cracks or fissures on the surface of microcapsules produced using SMP and Tween 80 combination at the optimal drying condition.
Industrial relevance
Walnut oil contains highly valuable constituents such as essential fatty acids, tocopherols, and phytosterols. However, a direct application of this functional oil in processed foods is problematic due to its low solubility and susceptibility to oxidation. These issues could be greatly overcome by using microencapsulation technology. Nowadays, this technology has received an increasing attention in food and pharmaceutical industries due to its unique features in protecting the functionality of ingredients. Spray drying technology is one of the most frequently used techniques for this aim. However, comprehensive studies need to be carried out in order to determine suitable operational conditions of spray drying system for improving physicochemical properties of finished powder.},

It was possible to create emulsions with OSA-modified starch isolated from Quinoa as sole emulsifier. Similar droplet sizes were obtained with emulsions prepared at 7\% (w/w) oil content using OSA-modified starch in the granular form or molecularly dissolved but large differences were observed regarding stability. Pickering emulsions kept their droplet size constant after one month while emulsions formulated with OSA-modified starch dissolved exhibited coalescence. All emulsions stabilized combining OSA-modified starch in granular form and in solution showed larger mean droplet sizes with no significant differences with respect to the order of addition. These emulsions were unstable due to coalescence regarding presence of free oil. Similar results were obtained when emulsions were prepared by combining OSA-modified granules with native starch in solution. The degree of surface coverage of starch granules was much lower in presence of starch in solution which indicates that OSA-starch is more surface active in the dissolved state than in granular form, although it led to unstable systems compared to starch granule stabilized Pickering emulsions, which demonstrated to be extremely stable.},

	abstract = {In continuous mechanical emulsification, droplets of a coarse premix are first deformed and disrupted. Secondly, the newly formed interface has to be stabilized. Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable, as droplets tend to coalesce. To avoid coalescence of droplets, different effects have to be taken into account. The objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of producing finely dispersed emulsions by using OSA starches as additive. Experiments were carried out using two commercially available OSA starches that differ mainly in viscosity of their aqueous solutions. In the experiments, the dispersed phase content, starch concentration as well as pH value and the influence of dissolved salts of different ion strength have been investigated. By droplet size analysis directly after production of oil-in-water emulsions the emulsifying properties of such starches were determined. Measurements of interfacial tension prove that OSA starches are surface active substances. It was shown by emulsification experiments that the stabilization of droplets by OSA starches is very efficient. The emulsification results achieved with OSA starches have been found to be independent from the type of starch and the starch concentration above the lower limit of starch needed for stabilization. The emulsification results are independent of pH value and ion valence. Therefore it can be concluded that steric hindrance is the main stabilizing mechanism of OSA starches. As proteins stabilize emulsion droplets mainly by electrostatic repulsive forces, the emulsification result depends strongly on pH, which leads to poor emulsification at pH values near the iso-electric point. The results of the work presented here suggest that whey proteins can be substituted by OSA starches with a specific advantage at low pH values near the iso-electric point of the protein.},

The WPI only or WPI/MD (90 : 10) powders were spherical and smooth, whereas the WPI/MD (50 : 50 and 10 : 90) powders exhibited pronounced surface collapse. Increasing the MD ratio resulted in higher bulk density and wettability, probably due to more compact physical structure and hydrophilic wall matrix. Surface free oil contents and microencapsulation efficiencies of powders were 11–16\% and 45–66\%, respectively, and no significant differences were observed between the samples. The crude avocado oil used in this study appeared to be stable against oxidation at cold and ambient temperatures, irrespective of microencapsulation.

Viscosity, size and size distribution of emulsions were found to be mainly governed by the aqueous phase viscosity. Maltodextrin DE 12 leading to more viscous aqueous phases was found to be more efficient for the production of finer emulsions. Whatever the composition, no oil oxidation was observed after processing and after 2weeks storage. After 3weeks, coarse emulsions presented two phases whilst the submicron ones were stable after more than 2months.},

Maltodextrin (MD) was mixed with gum Arabic (GA), whey protein concentrate (WPC) or two types of modified starch (Hi-Cap 100TM and Capsul TA®) at a 25:75 ratio. The feed emulsions used for particle production were characterized for stability, viscosity and droplet size. The best encapsulation efficiency was obtained for MD:Hi-Cap followed by the MD:Capsul combination, while the lowest encapsulation efficiency was obtained for MD:WPC, which also showed poorer emulsion stability. Particles were hollow, with the active material embedded in the wall material matrix, and had no apparent cracks or fissures. During the oxidative stability study, MD:WPC combination was the wall material that best protected the active material against lipid oxidation.},

The objective of the present study was to examine the inﬂuence of process conditions on microencapsulation of Nigella sativa oil using spray drying, by applying the response surface methodology (RSM) by central composite design. The independent variables were: the content of wall material (10–30\%), the concentration of oil (10–30\%) and temperature (150–190 °C of inlet air drying). The microencapsulation efﬁciency, moisture content, solubility, particle size, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant activity by 1,1-diphenyl-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) were analysed as responses. Powders were gauged by a complete 23 central composite rotatable design. The optimal conditions were determined to be 30\% wall material, 10\% concentration of oil, and 160 °C drying inlet air temperature. The optimised spray-dried powder had high values for MEE (92.71\%), solubility (91.38\%), and total phenolic content TPC (137.68 mg/100 g) as well as low values of DPPH (IC50 of 1.61 mg/g), moisture content (1.03\%), and particle size (15.516 μm).},

	abstract = {Nanoparticles suspensions very often present a physicochemical instability during their storage. In order to overcome this lack of stability and facilitate the handling of these colloidal systems, the water elimination from the aqueous dispersions to obtain a dry solid form appears as the most promising strategy. The present paper reports the use of the spray-drying technique for the nanocapsules (NC) suspensions conversion into redispersible dried solid particles in presence of different water-soluble excipients as drying auxiliaries. Following the combination of additives solutions with NC suspension, the final dispersion homogeneity was favoured, avoiding phase separations. According to the size measurement after a simple atomisation experiment, the NC, which have a thin and fragile shell structure can withstand the shear forces developed for the feed disintegration in droplets. During drying, certain additives molecules are able to act as NC protectors. The physicochemical characterization of the spray-dried powders included an investigation of their properties, such as residual moisture content, particulate density, morphology and redispersion in water. Using a NC concentration of 1\% (w/v), the best result was obtained with the preparation containing 10\% (w/v) of lactose which led to more desirable powder morphology and favouring NC suspension reconstitution with only ≈2\% of the size distribution in the micrometer range. The spray-drying technique is an attractive method to improve the NC conservation and facilitate future handling.},

After spray-drying, powders in which the oil phases consisting of fats with intermediate melting points, such as hardened coconut oil and butter fat, had the highest surface coverage of fat, approximately 34\%. The powder with soybean oil as the oil phase had a surface coverage of fat of approximately 15\%. The high-melting hardened rapeseed oil was almost completely encapsulated after spray-drying. After storage in a humid atmosphere, fat was released onto all the powder surfaces (surface fat after storage, between 50-65\%) except for those with hardened rapeseed oil in which the fat remained encapsulated. These observations are consistent with the powder structure observed by SEM. The surface composition estimated by ESCA for spray-dried sodium caseinate/lactose-containing emulsions with different amounts of soybean oil and a constant lactose/sodium caseinate ratio showed an almost completely encapsulated oil-phase after drying. Storage of these powders in a humid atmosphere leads to a release of fat onto the powder surface even if the soybean oil content is low (1\% of the dry weight). Powders made from soybean oil emulsions with sodium caseinate alone exhibit a much lower degree of encapsulation than in the system where lactose is present.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Oil mixtures of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and d-limonene in mixing ratios from 10 to 100 wt\% were encapsulated in modified starch (wall material) by spray drying to produce oil-rich powders. The oil load (mass ratio of oil mixture to wall material) of the infeed emulsion markedly influenced the properties of the infeed liquid and the characteristics of the resulting powder. The viscosity of the infeed liquid and the particle size of the powder exponentially decreased with increasing oil load, while the emulsion droplet size in the infeed liquid increased. In addition, retention of d-limonene during spray drying also decreased markedly with increasing oil load. Irrespective of the different oil loads and concentrations of the wall material, d-limonene retention was well correlated with the emulsion droplet diameter of the infeed liquid. The encapsulation efficiency of the oil mixture exhibited a maximum value (almost 100\%) at an oil load between 0.5 and 1.0, before decreasing at higher oil loads. At an oil load of 2.0, the encapsulation efficiency of d-limonene was reduced to almost zero, while around 40\% of the initial MCT was encapsulated in the powder. The increase in oil load also led to increased amounts of surface oil of MCT and d-limonene in the resulting powder due to the increasing emulsion droplet diameter of the infeed liquids. Practical Application: This study proposes the microencapsulation of medium-chain triglycerides under high-oil-load conditions by spray drying. The powders prepared by this process provide significant benefits in terms of rapid energy conversion after consumption without accumulation in the body. Important quality factors of the powder products such as the encapsulation efficiency and the amount of surface oil were examined to understand the optimum process conditions for spray drying.},

The reconstituted emulsion from MD of DE 10 was less stable than those from MDs of DE 2 and DE 25. The increase rates of average diameter of reconstituted oil-droplet could be correlated by the zero-order reaction model. By FT-IR and powder X-ray diffraction measurement, spectrum results suggest a stronger interaction between MD of DE 10 and SSE compared to the other two MDs.

Beginning at a presymptomatic age, 2 groups of male 3xTgAD mice were fed a diet containing a physiological enantiomeric precursor of ketone bodies (KET) or an isocaloric carbohydrate diet. The results of behavioral tests performed at 4 and 7 months after diet initiation revealed that KET-fed mice exhibited significantly less anxiety in 2 different tests. 3xTgAD mice on the KET diet also exhibited significant, albeit relatively subtle, improvements in performance on learning and memory tests. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that KET-fed mice exhibited decreased Aβ deposition in the subiculum, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, and the amygdala. KET-fed mice exhibited reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the same regions of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. Thus, a novel ketone ester can ameliorate proteopathic and behavioral deficits in a mouse AD model.},

	abstract = {The pancreatic lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of complex lipid emulsions dedicated to enteral nutrition in humans was studied in vitro. The four complex emulsions used had variable triglyceride composition and particle sizes, and a similar phospholipid content. They contained triglycerides in the form of pure medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), pure long-chain triglycerides (LCT), or a mixture of MCT and LCT (MCT/LCT 20/80 wt/wt). The mean droplet sizes of the emulsions were 0.19 μm (MCT), 0.43 μm (LCT), 0.46 μm, or 3.18 μm (MCT/LCT). The phase distribution of phospholipids (emulsified particles/aqueous medium) was shown to be related to the saturation of the available triglyceride interface area. The presence of MCTs appears to protect phospholipids from being removed from the droplet surface by bile salt micelles. The affinity of pancreatic lipase for the emulsions was comparable, and calcium ions were shown to play a key role in suppressing the lag phase in a surface area-dependent manner. The enzyme velocity was inversly related to the mean particle size of the emulsions. Pure MCTs were hydrolyzed faster than pure LCTs. With comparable sizes, a mixed MCT/LCT emulsion was hydrolyzed more slowly than a pure MCT emulsion. In conclusion, varying the mean droplet size or the triglyceride composition of emulsions affects their hydrolysis rate catalyzed by pancreatic lipase. The present findings could help in preparing new emulsions for enteral feeding, especially for patients with a reduced digestive capacity.},

In this regard the medium chain triglycerides are a direct source of cellular energy and can be a nonpharmacological alternative to the neuronal death for lack of it, that occurs in Alzheimer patients.
OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the impact of coconut oil in the development of Alzheimer's dementia, in any degree of dementia. Also determine whether this improvement influences within variables such as sex and suffering or not Type II Diabetes Mellitus.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: a prospective study was conducted in patients with Alzheimer's dementia, with a control and an intervention group which was administered 40 ml/day of extra virgin coconut oil. The parameters evaluated were the mini test scores Lobo cognitive test, pre and post intervention in both groups.
RESULTS: it was observed in subjects taking the product, a statistically significant increase in test score MECWOLF and therefore an improvement in cognitive status, improving especially women's, those without diabetes mellitus type II, and severe patients.

The various products of coconut include tender coconut water, copra, coconut oil, raw kernel, coconut cake, coconut toddy, coconut shell and wood based products, coconut leaves, coir pith etc. Its all parts are used in someway or another in the daily life of the people in the traditional coconut growing areas. It is the unique source of various natural products for the development of medicines against various diseases and also for the development of industrial products. The parts of its fruit like coconut kernel and tender coconut water have numerous medicinal properties such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, antidermatophytic, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, immunostimulant. Coconut water and coconut kernel contain microminerals and nutrients, which are essential to human health, and hence coconut is used as food by the peoples in the globe, mainly in the tropical countries. The coconut palm is, therefore, eulogised as ‘Kalpavriksha’ (the all giving tree) in Indian classics, and thus the current review describes the facts and phenomena related to its use in health and disease prevention.},

	abstract = {This study aims to determine the stability improving effects of size-reduced dietary fibers in food emulsions. Orange zest fiber and corn fiber were microfluidized under high pressure (up to 15,000 psi). Model emulsions were prepared by adding 1, 2 and 3\% of the fibers into the mixture of 3\% whey protein isolate and 20 and 50\% oil. These mixtures were homogenized through both colloid mill and microfluidizer to form model emulsions. Rheological properties such as flow and oscillation were measured with frequency scanning rheometer, and emulsion stabilities were measured with dispersion analyzer. Increase in oil amount increased emulsion stabilities independent from fiber content. Likewise, ascending fiber amount also improved stabilities. At constant oil level, 3\% fiber containing emulsions had higher elastic and viscous moduli (G' and G”) and viscosity values than those of other groups in same material. In general, addition of dietary fiber into model food emulsions improved stability properties. Practical Applications Dietary fiber issue has been widely discussed, and trends in usage of dietary fibers have been increasing for years. Food emulsions and emulsified food products now have a substantial place in basic diet of humans. In practice, widely and daily used products such as mayonnaise, salad dressings, butter, etc., are either emulsions or emulsified products. This article deals with enabling usage of some dietary fibers in emulsions. All products mentioned above are potential applications of this research. Also a novel technology, microfluidization could be effectively used for homogenization process. The results are useful in producing food emulsions with higher emulsion stabilities.},

Reports detailing reduced brain glucose metabolism in the early stages of AD led to the hypothesis that alternate energy sources aimed at increasing neuronal metabolism may protect neurons and thus benefit patients with AD. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are metabolized to ketone bodies that serve as an alternative source of energy for neurons. Data from clinical trials suggest that MCTs improve cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD in apolipoprotein E4-negative patients. Adverse events observed were mild and included minor gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, dyspepsia, and flatulence. However, since genomic profiles are not routinely conducted in patients with AD in a clinical setting, the role of MCTs in clinical practice seems to be minimal.},

However, the distribution of these fatty acids on the triacylglycerol (TAG) molecule and the molecular TAG species generated by this stereospecificity are characteristic for various native dietary TAGs. Fat randomization or interesterification is a process involving the positional redistribution of fatty acids, which leads to the generation of new TAG molecular species. A comparison between native and randomized TAGs is the subject of this review with regards to the role of stereospecificity of fatty acids in metabolic processing and effects on fasting lipids and postprandial lipemia. The positioning of unsaturated versus saturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position of TAGs indicate differences in early metabolic processing and postprandial clearance, which may explain modulatory effects on atherogenecity and thrombogenecity. Both human and animal studies are discussed with implications for human health.},

	abstract = {The digestion and metabolism of lipids continues to generate considerable scientific interest, with food emulsions increasingly being seen as a mechanism by which lipid uptake may be controlled. Scientific advancement in this field is partly being driven by the ongoing need to address the obesity crisis, for which the enhancement of satiety and/or reduction of energy intake is seen as a positive solution in achieving more effective weight management. Yet the ability to regulate lipid uptake is also seen as beneficial in other areas, such as improved nutrition for the young and/or elderly and in cardiovascular protection. Because of the complexity of food digestion, the majority of research in this area has been applied to model or highly controlled systems. Through this approach it is becoming increasingly apparent that food emulsion structure and stability does have a contributing role on lipid digestion and metabolism. There is now a clear indication of how emulsion stability within the stomach affects emptying rates. There have been considerable developments in understanding the relationship between interfacial composition and lipolysis in both the gastric and intestinal regions, and how this relates to lipid uptake/metabolism. There is also an emerging understanding of the contribution of gastrointestinal biophysics to emulsion structure and stability, and how intestinal motility is in turn impacted by structural aspects, such as relative changes in particle size. Understanding of lipid digestion has been progressed through recent advancements in the sophistication of in vitro models. These are now seen as providing a more realistic representation of physiological conditions, both in terms of biochemical environment, and the biophysics of the gastrointestinal tract. Improvements in the validity of such models against in vivo and clinical behaviours is allowing aspects of emulsion digestion to be observed without the immediate need of costly human trials. Accordingly, emulsion systems with increasing structural complexity are now able to be characterised in terms of digestion behaviours. The ability to design food emulsions with specific lipid digestion profiles may allow the development of mainstream foods with particular physiological properties, such as enhanced satiation, or targeted delivery.},

The results confirm that the release behaviour of fatty acids from emulsions during digestion is related not only to the position of the fatty acids in the triglycerides in the fat/oil, but also to the length of the carbon chain of the fatty acid. The rates and the extents of the digestion of lipids consisting of short chain fatty acids are higher than those of lipids consisting of long chain fatty acids.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of oral administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on inhibition of intimal thickening after balloon angioplasty in the rabbit iliac artery atherosclerotic model.
METHODS: Iliac atherosclerosis was induced in 24 rabbits, and balloon angioplasty was performed. At angioplasty, 24 rabbits were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 per group): Group 1: controls not receiving oral ATRA administration; Group 2: receiving oral ATRA (0.6 mg.kg-1.d-1) administration beginning 1 week prior to angioplasty and continuing for 4 weeks; Group 3: receiving oral ATRA (0.6 mg.kg-1.d-1) administration beginning immediately after angioplasty and continuing for 4 wk; Group 4: receiving oral ATRA (0.6 mg.kg-1.d-1) administration beginning 1 wk after angioplasty and continuing for 4 wk. Values of cross-sectional area, ratio of intimal/medial area and thickness were determined by a computer-based morphometric system, and cell proliferative activity was assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation.
RESULTS: Both the cross-sectional area and the ratio of intimal/medial area and thickness were significantly reduced by ATRA administration compared with control group (P {\textless} 0.01). The inhibitory effect is less potent when ATRA is administered 1 week before angioplasty. The ATRA inhibitory effect when administered 1 week after angioplasty is not different significantly form that when administered immediately after angioplasty. The 3H-thymidine incorporation was also decreased in ATRA-treated rabbits compared with controls (P {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Oral ATRA administration can be effective in inhibiting intimal thickening after balloon angioplasty. It is reasonable that ATRA should be administered immediately after angioplasty.},

Across three studies, we measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Studies 2 and 3) participants’ energy need and gave them the opportunity to eat provided snacks. Participants also reported their SES during childhood and their current SES. Results revealed that people who grew up in high-SES environments regulated their food intake on the basis of their immediate energy need; they ate more when their need was high than when their need was low. This relationship was not observed among people who grew up in low-SES environments. These individuals consumed comparably high amounts of food when their current energy need was high and when it was low. Childhood SES may have a lasting impact on food regulation.},

	abstract = {Background Understanding diet quality is relevant to identify those who would benefit from nutrition interventions and policies. An understanding of overview quality of the Mexican diet is missing so the objective is to create a Mexican Diet Quality Index (Mx-DQI) and examine it by socioeconomic status (SES) among Mexican adults.
Data/methods Dietary data was collected by 24-hour recall in 3,173 adults aged 20 years or older who participated in the nationally representative Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012. The Mx-DQI was constructed based on the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which aligns well with Dietary Guidelines in Mexico. An adequacy category encompassed total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, and seafood and plant proteins, whereas a moderation category included refined grains, fatty acids, sodium, and added sugars. Weights for each category followed the Health Eating Index model with updates for the new guidelines. The maximum total Mx-DQI score was 100 points. Household assets were used to create three tertiles of socioeconomic status. Unadjusted means with standard errors were computed for both the total Mx-DQI score and the individual Mx-DQI component scores by SES. The continuous measure of the total Mx-DQI score was then categorized into tertiles for evaluating variations in the diet quality score. Survey weights were applied to make results nationally representative.
Results The difference in total Mx-DQI score was small but significant among SES groups (high SES=42.1 pts; medium SES=39.2 pts; low SES=40.1 pts, p{\textless}0.01). Adults with high compared with medium and low SES had higher scores for total fruit (2.1 pts; 1.5 pts; 1.3 pts, respectively, p{\textless}0.01), whole fruit (2.5 pts; 1.9 pts; 1.7 pts, respectively, p{\textless}0.01), greens and beans (1.2 pts; 0.9 pts; 0.6 pts, respectively, p{\textless}0.01), dairy (3.9 pts; 3.0 pts; 2.1 pts, respectively, p{\textless}0.01), and refined grains (5.5 pts; 4.2 pts; 3.2 pts, respectively, p{\textless}0.01). Conversely, adults with low versus medium and high SES had higher scores for fatty acids (9.1 pts; 7.3 pts; 6.2 pts, respectively, p{\textless}0.01), and added sugars (5.6 pts; 4.1 pts; 4.0 pts, respectively, p{\textless}0.01). To examine problem areas of diet more closely in each SES group, we looked at the group of individuals in the lowest Mx-DQI score tertile. Medium SES compared with low and SES had the highest proportion of individuals with a poor score (37.7\%; 34.3\%; and 31.5\%; respectively). The proportion of adults with poorer Mx-DQI scores for total fruit, whole fruit, dairy, and refined grains was consistently lower in high versus medium and low SES, while the proportion of individuals with poorer Mx-DQI scores for fatty acids and added sugars was consistently lower in low versus medium and high SES groups.
Conclusion There is a small but significant difference in total Mx-DQI score by SES. However, differences in Mx-DQI score distribution by SES are higher. The findings of this study provide an insight for targeting nutrition interventions and policies that can impact diet quality according to SES.

	abstract = {A large body of epidemiologic data show that diet quality follows a socioeconomic gradient. Whereas higher-quality diets are associated with greater affluence, energy-dense diets that are nutrient-poor are preferentially consumed by persons of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and of more limited economic means. As this review demonstrates, whole grains, lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products, and fresh vegetables and fruit are more likely to be consumed by groups of higher SES. In contrast, the consumption of refined grains and added fats has been associated with lower SES. Although micronutrient intake and, hence, diet quality are affected by SES, little evidence indicates that SES affects either total energy intakes or the macronutrient composition of the diet. The observed associations between SES variables and diet-quality measures can be explained by a variety of potentially causal mechanisms. The disparity in energy costs (\$/MJ) between energy-dense and nutrient-dense foods is one such mechanism; easy physical access to low-cost energy-dense foods is another. If higher SES is a causal determinant of diet quality, then the reported associations between diet quality and better health, found in so many epidemiologic studies, may have been confounded by unobserved indexes of social class. Conversely, if limited economic resources are causally linked to low-quality diets, some current strategies for health promotion, based on recommending high-cost foods to low-income people, may prove to be wholly ineffective. Exploring the possible causal relations between SES and diet quality is the purpose of this review.},

	abstract = {Production of beta-lactamases, the enzymes that degrade beta-lactam antibiotics, is the most widespread and threatening mechanism of antibiotic resistance. In the past, extensive research has focused on the structure, function, and ecology of beta-lactamases while limited efforts were placed on the regulatory mechanisms of beta-lactamases. Recently, increasing evidence demonstrate a direct link between beta-lactamase induction and cell wall metabolism in Gram-negative bacteria. Specifically, expression of beta-lactamase could be induced by the liberated murein fragments, such as muropeptides. This article summarizes current knowledge on cell wall metabolism, beta-lactam antibiotics, and beta-lactamases. In particular, we comprehensively reviewed recent studies on the beta-lactamase induction by muropeptides via two major molecular mechanisms (the AmpG–AmpR–AmpC pathway and BlrAB-like two-component regulatory system) in Gram-negative bacteria. The signaling pathways for beta-lactamase induction offer a broad array of promising targets for the discovery of new antibacterial drugs used for combination therapies. Therefore, to develop effective mitigation strategies against the widespread beta-lactam resistance, examination of the molecular basis of beta-lactamase induction by cell wall fragment is highly warranted.},

	abstract = {A recently developed confirmatory LC-MS method has been applied to the quantification of five major β-lactam antibiotics in suspect raw bovine milk samples that gave a positive response with receptor-based (BetaStar) and rapid microbial inhibitory screen tests (Delvotest SP). In total, 18 presumptive positive raw milk samples were reanalyzed; 16 samples showed traces of antibiotic residues that could be identified and quantified by the LC-MS method, ranging from the limits of confirmation up to 38 μg/kg. Of the positive samples, only five (∼30\%) were found to be violative of EU maximum residue limits. The most frequently detected antibiotic residues were cloxacillin and penicillin G, the former often in combination with amoxicillin or ampicillin. This study compares the results obtained by the three methods on identical samples and addresses how these relate to certain criteria such as sensitivity and selectivity. Furthermore, the limitations of the LC-MS method and the potential impact of the presence of frequently more than one residue in the same milk sample on the response of the rapid test methods are discussed.

	abstract = {Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are readily oxidized in the liver. Animal and human studies have shown that the fast rate of oxidation of MCFA leads to greater energy expenditure (EE). Most animal studies have also demonstrated that the greater EE with MCFA relative to long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) results in less body weight gain and decreased size of fat depots after several months of consumption. Furthermore, both animal and human trials suggest a greater satiating effect of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) compared with long-chain triglycerides (LCT). The aim of this review is to evaluate existing data describing the effects of MCT on EE and satiety and determine their potential efficacy as agents in the treatment of human obesity. Animal studies are summarized and human trials more systematically evaluated because the primary focus of this article is to examine the effects of MCT on human energy metabolism and satiety. Hormones including cholescytokinin, peptide YY, gastric inhibitory peptide, neurotensin and pancreatic polypeptide have been proposed to be involved in the mechanism by which MCT may induce satiety; however, the exact mechanisms have not been established. From the literature reviewed, we conclude that MCT increase energy expenditure, may result in faster satiety and facilitate weight control when included in the diet as a replacement for fats containing LCT.},

Coffee creamers containing plant proteins had significantly greater apparent viscosity but lower L* values than did creamers made with dairy proteins. Creamers made with higher concentrations of isolated wheat protein exhibited syneresis, whereas no syneresis occurred if sodium caseinate was the predominant protein. Only the creamer formulated with soy protein isolate alone exhibited feathering when added to hot, brewed coffee. These results indicate that coffee creamers can be formulated with plant proteins and sodium caseinate.},

	abstract = {Leavening of baked products is the process where air bubbles that have been incorporated into the dough or batter during mixing are expanded by carbon dioxide gas produced during yeast fermentation or chemical leavening reactions or by the effect of heating. The expansion of the air bubbles causes the batter or dough to increase in size and expands the cell structure to improve the taste and texture of the final baked product. The three main leavening gases are air, steam, and carbon dioxide gas. Air is incorporated during mixing. Steam is produced when the water in the dough or batter is vaporized during baking. Carbon dioxide gas is produced by chemical leavening reactions or by yeast fermentation. The main sources of carbon dioxide in chemical leavening reactions are sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, and ammonium bicarbonate. Ammonium bicarbonate dissociates during heating to release all available carbon dioxide. Sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate release less than half of the available carbon dioxide in the dough or batter. For this reason, leavening acids are added to increase carbon dioxide release. Different leavening acids have different reaction rates and different effects on the batter, dough, and final product. This allows for the design of sophisticated leavening systems to improve and extend product functionality.},

Results suggested an East-West differentiation in Ethiopia, the primary centre of diversification of C. arabica.

	abstract = {The fast mixing of aqueous solutions of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate could immediately result in amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). Under vigorous stirring, the formed ACC in the precipitation system will dissolve first and, then, transform within minutes to produce crystalline forms of vaterite and calcite. After that, the solution-mediated mechanism dominates the transformation of the thermodynamically unstable vaterite into the thermodynamically stable calcite. Although ACC is the least stable form of the six anhydrous phases of calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)), it could be, however, produced and stabilized by a variety of organisms. To better understand the formation-transformation mechanism of ACC and vaterite into calcite, ex-situ methods (i.e., scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy) were used to characterize the formation-transformation process of ACC and vaterite in aqueous systems without organic additives, showing that ACC sampled at different conditions has different properties (i.e., lifetime, morphology, and spectrum characterization). It is also very interesting to capture the obviously polycrystalline particles of CaCO(3) during the transformation process from vaterite to calcite, which suggests the formation mechanism for the calcite superstructure with multidimensional morphology.},

	abstract = {A number of organisms produce crystalline calcium carbonate via a metastable precursor phase termed amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). ACC also forms during production of CaCO3 for industrial purposes, e.g., paper manufacturing and synthesis of fillers for polymers. Previous studies suggest that the local structure of ACC controls crystallization kinetics and pathways, i.e., the crystalline polymorph(s) that form(s) in the process. We used pair distribution function (PDF) analysis to provide evidence that the local structure of ACC gradually changes as the pH of the synthesis solutions is increased from 10.6 to 12.7, at ambient conditions. These changes correlate with the mole fraction of incorporated hydroxide ions, which varies gradually from negligible at pH 10.6 to 0.12 at pH 12.7. At lower pH (10.5), vaterite and calcite formed in less than 2 min, but as the pH increased, the lifetime of ACC increased, and it transformed directly to calcite (i.e., no vaterite intermediate). Although higher pH led to a preferable transformation into calcite with decreasing crystal size, variations in ACC local structure cannot be linked to development of a calcite like motif, as has been suggested. On the basis of comparing the measured vaterite PDF to a range of structural models to determine Ca–Ca distances, we found no obvious structural similarity between vaterite and the ACC precursor either, although such analysis is complicated by the ambiguity of the vaterite structure. Presumably, the absence of vaterite and the prolonged ACC stability with increasing synthesis pH could indicate inhibition of crystal nucleation and growth by hydroxide ions.},

The method can be used to evaluate the air content of low-density doughs and to follow the changing density of a proofing dough sample. The method is applied to evaluate the effect of flour strength and surfactant addition on dough aeration and subsequent proofing. Doughs were mixed in a high-speed mixer from two flours, a strong breadmaking flour and a weak flour. Surfactants sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) and diacetyl tartrate esters of monoglyceride (DATEM) were added at three levels, and the air content, proofing dynamics, and baked loaf quality were evaluated. The air content of dough was proportional to headspace pressure in the mixer, while the strong flour occluded less air than the weak flour. Surfactants greatly improved the volume of baked loaves but appeared to have no significant effect on air incorporation during mixing. The addition of surfactants appeared to increase the rate of growth of the dough piece during proofing, possibly due to increased bubble breakup during mixing or to increased rates of mass transfer of CO2 into bubbles during proofing.},

The present model considers the expansion as a chemical reaction, which producing gas leads to the growth and the coalescence of bubbles, which form in the pseudoplastic paste, thus conferring to the loaf its final volume. The fermentation kinetic was investigated by monitoring the variation of the dough volume vs time by means of image analysis. The leavening process can be divided into three stages: the lag stage, a positive acceleration stage and a negative acceleration stage. Aim of the model developed in this study was described the variation of dough volume y as a function of time t, i.e. y = f(t). A modified Gompertz model was chosen as the best descriptive model of the leavening process. Quite good agreement was observed between experimental data and model parameters.},

	abstract = {Gas production and gas retention properties of doughs are pivotal to the manufacture of bread of good quality, but these properties are rarely measured directly in fermenting dough due to a paucity of suitable instrumentation. A digital image analysis-based method was used to measure the dynamic specific volume (DSV) of various chemically leavened dough systems. Sodium bicarbonate (1.4–4.2 g per 100 g of flour) in combination with equivalent neutralizing amounts of the leavening acidulants glucono-delta-lactone, potassium acid tartrate, adipic acid or sodium acid pyrophosphate consistently increased the specific volume of bread dough so that void fractions in the dough spanned between 5 and 67\% at ordinary fermentation temperatures. The relationship between the specific volume of dough at the end of fermentation and the actual gas evolved (measured independently) was essentially linear and was characterized by a slope that provided a good index of the actual gas-trapping properties of dough. Therefore, the use of the DSV technique in conjunction with chemical leaveners offers the possibility of obtaining quantitative, real time information on the gassing capacity of the leavening system and the gas-holding capacity of the dough.},

	abstract = {Chemical leavening involves the action of an acid on bicarbonate to release carbon dioxide gas for aeration of a dough or batter during mixing and baking. The aeration provides a light, porous cell structure, fine grain, and a texture with desirable appearance along with palatability to baked goods. There are essentially two components in a chemical leavening system: bicarbonate that supplies carbon dioxide gas and an acid that triggers the liberation of carbon dioxide from bicarbonate upon contact with moisture. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is the primary source of carbon dioxide gas in practically all chemical leavening systems. The prevalent baking acids in modern chemical leavening systems are sodium or calcium salts of ortho, pyro, and complex phosphoric acids. Baking soda determines the amount of carbon dioxide evolved, whereas the type of acid controls the speed of liberation. By far, the greatest use of leavening in the home is in preleavened mixes. Pancake, biscuit, and cake mixes have long been established as commercial products. Sales of frozen or refrigerated doughs and batters have increased rapidly in recent years. This trend is attributable to increased refrigeration and freezer capacity in stores and to the development of new and improved ingredients. Practically all of the leavening acids used in the mix industry today are of the phosphate type. The blending of baking powder is essentially a physical mixing of the various components in a large-scale batch mixer and is often carried out in automated plants.},

	abstract = {This scientific opinion of EFSA Panel on food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids deals with the safety evaluation of the mixture of the active substances citric acid (E330, CAS No 77-92-9, FCM Substance No 139) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (E500ii, CAS No 144-55-8, FCM Substance No 21), which is intended to be used as a carbon dioxide generator in liquid absorbent pads in the packaging of fresh or frozen meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables. Depending on absorption capacity needed, pure cellulose or a mixture of cellulose and polyacrylic acid sodium salt crosslinked may be used as absorber. The Panel noted that if the active substances are used not in direct contact with food, but are placed in a pad under conditions where its absorption capacity is not exceeded, then no migration is to be expected and therefore no exposure from the consumption of the packed food is expected. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the mixture of the active substances citric acid (E330) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (E500ii), as carbon dioxide generator in liquid absorbent pads in the packaging of food such as fresh or frozen meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables, does not raise a safety concern. The absorbent pads should be used only under conditions in which the liquid absorption capacity is not exceeded and direct contact between the substance and the food is excluded. copyright EFSA.},

	abstract = {Among a number of impediments to a wider use of chemical leavening agents in bakery applications is the lack of standardized instrumentation capable of providing information on the rates of CO2 production from chemical leaveners in a format that is meaningful to both the technologist (i.e., the dough rate of reaction or DRR) and the researcher (e.g., in terms of fundamental units—kmol CO2 per kg of dough per s). This paper presents an original methodology to carry out the DRR test using a commercial pressuremeter, the Gassmart apparatus, and to model the kinetics of CO2 evolution of chemically leavened dough. Lean formula doughs were leavened at 27 and 39 °C with four chemical leavening systems containing sodium bicarbonate and one of four leavening acids, sodium acid pyrophosphate 40 (SAPP), adipic acid (ADA), potassium acid tartrate (KAT), and glucono-δ-lactone (GDL). Chemical kinetics theory was used to gain an insight into the reaction mechanisms responsible for the evolution of carbon dioxide from the leaveners. A first-order reaction kinetics model was found to be suitable for describing the neutralizing properties of GDL and ADA leavening systems, whereas a first-order reaction kinetics model for irreversible parallel reactions better described the leavening properties of the acidic salts KAT and SAPP.},

	abstract = {Monoterpenes are widely used in food technology, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and as compounds of agricultural importance. It is known that compounds comprising this class can be transformed by a variety of organisms, namely by: bacteria, fungi, yeasts, plants or isolated enzymes. Biotransformations, as one of the most important tools of green chemistry, allow obtaining new products using whole cells of micro-organisms or isolated enzymes in mild reaction conditions. Therefore, biotransformations of monoterpenes, by different type of reaction such as: epoxidation, oxidation and stereoselective hydroxylation, resulted in the production of so desired, enantiomerically defined compounds that can be advised as natural seem to be interesting. Bearing in mind that such processes are carried out also by easy to maintain, photoautotrophic micro-organisms cultivated at large scale, this paper is focused on biotransformations of acyclic, monocyclic and bicyclic monoterpenes by freshwater or haliphylic cyanobacteria and microalgae on the way of mainly stereoselective hydroxylation. Moreover, aspects of potential industrial application of obtained products in medicine, perfume, cosmetics and food industry are discussed.},
