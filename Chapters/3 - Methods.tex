\section{Model architectures}
In this section, the models used in our research are explained.

\subsection{ViT}
The visual attention model used for the 1D-Spectra was inspired from Yoni Gottesmans blogpost \cite{noauthor_interpretable_2023}. It takes the well-known 2D-ViT model as a basis and is adapted to work with one-dimensional inputs.
The model was changed to fit the spectral input data with 1024 data points. Further, a patch-size of 20 data-points was chosen.

\section{Model evaluation}

To evaluate the models' performance and training process, the loss and accuracy was obtained and plotted. Furthermore, the test data obtained as described in \ref{test_data} was predicted and visualized in a confusion matrix to be found in Appendix \ref{ApendixB}.
