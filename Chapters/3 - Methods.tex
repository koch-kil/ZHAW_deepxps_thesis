\section{Model architectures}
In this section, the models used in our research are explained.

\subsection{CNN}
% explain the structure
The CNN model used is based on the standard architecture with two convolutional blocks. The blocks consist of multiple consecutive convolutional layers with increasing kernel sizes.

The corresponding code can be found in the Appendix \ref{AppendixB}

\subsection{GRU}

\subsection{ViT}
The visual attention model used for the 1D-Spectra was inspired from Yoni Gottesmans blogpost \cite{noauthor_interpretable_2023}. It takes the published 2D-ViT model  as a basis and is adapted to work with one-dimensional inputs.
The model was adapted to fit the spectral input data with 1024 data points. Further, a patch-size of 20 data-points and a head of 6 was chosen.

\section{Model evaluation}

To evaluate the models' performance and training process, the loss and accuracy was obtained and plotted. Furthermore, the test data obtained as described in \ref{test_data} was predicted and visualized in a confusion matrix to be found in Appendix \ref{ApendixB}.
