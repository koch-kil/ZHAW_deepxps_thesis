\label{Chapter4}
The approach of modelling spectra and training a neural network model on their structure-label relation is an inherently biased approach, as we add the prior assumption of the model to create accurate spectra. Although this is clearly not the preferred baseline, scarce availability of labelled data often forces one to accept trade-offs. Nevertheless, this does not immediately imply failure at our tasks, but more importantly strongly depends on the prior assumption of spectra modelling. The following structure resembles our tasks formulated in the \nameref{Chapter1}. For each task, a table with the respective models, datasets and accuracies is shown.
