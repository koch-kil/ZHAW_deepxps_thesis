X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a spectroscopic technique which allows researchers to investigate the chemical composition of surfaces. It is based on the fundamental principle of the photoelectric effect first described by Einstein \cite{einstein_uber_1905} in 1905. Later, Rutherford 

With the information depth of XPS at $\sim$10 nm, it is possible to probe surfaces and - depending on the sample - ultra thin films.
Thus, XPS is used across multiple fields in the material science domain to determine surface properties, such as corrosion, welding, fatigue, oxidation, coatings, adhesives, catalysis and semiconductors \cite{noauthor_x-ray_nodate}.

% Second part: research gap or the relevance of the work for research
% The aim is to show which areas have been neglected so far or have recently gained importance.

% Third part: objective of the work, formulate your own task as precisely as possible
% If necessary in the form of form of testable hypotheses
